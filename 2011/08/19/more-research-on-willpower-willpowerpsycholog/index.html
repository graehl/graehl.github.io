	<h2 class="title">More Research on Willpower</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Baumeister has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313659075&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> coming out on willpower. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">NYTimes article</a> about his work, summarized and discussed on <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/75s/link_nytimes_essay_on_willpower_based_on_an/">LessWrong</a>.</p>
<p></p>  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://jonathan.graehl.org/tag/willpower">previously discussed</a> much of this. But some of it is new research.<p></p>  It&#8217;s still possible that the only thing being depleted is glucose available to the brain (which is most readily available from stored liver glycogen, or food). But there may be other chemical resources involved. In any case, weighing and making choices taxes the brain; I&#8217;m not sure how much more or less than e.g. solving puzzles or reading and thinking critically.<p></p>  Quoting from the LessWrong summary:<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">
</span><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">You spend the most willpower when you have to make AND implement your decisions:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">which phase of the decision-making process was most fatiguing? To find out, Kathleen Vohs, a former colleague of Baumeister’s now at the University of Minnesota, performed an experiment using the self-service Web site of Dell Computers. One group in the experiment carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of various features available for a computer — the type of screen, the size of the hard drive, etc. — without actually making a final decision on which ones to choose. A second group was given a list of predetermined specifications and told to configure a computer by going through the laborious, step-by-step process of locating the specified features among the arrays of options and then clicking on the right ones. The purpose of this was to duplicate everything that happens in the postdecisional phase, when the choice is implemented.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The third group had to figure out for themselves which features they wanted on their computers and go through the process of choosing them; they didn’t simply ponder options (like the first group) or implement others’ choices (like the second group). They had to cast the die, and that turned out to be the most fatiguing task of all. When self-control was measured, they were the one who were most depleted, by far</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you reluctant to make trade-offs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Once you’re mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren’t a lot of protracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability and therefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call a cognitive miser, hoarding your energy.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">If you’re shopping, you’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best</em><span> </span>(an especially easy strategy if someone else is paying). Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers who know how to time their sales, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experiments involving tailored suits and new cars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you more likely to take the path of least resistance:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">As they started picking features, customers would carefully weigh the choices, but<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">as decision fatigue set in, they would start settling for whatever the default option was. And the more tough choices they encountered early in the process — like going through those 56 colors to choose the precise shade of gray or brown — the quicker people became fatigued and settled for the path of least resistance by taking the default option.</em><span> </span>By manipulating the order of the car buyers’ choices, the researchers found that the customers would end up settling for different kinds of options, and the average difference totaled more than 1,500 euros per car (about $2,000 at the time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Testing willpower depletion in rural Indian villages:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Most of us in America won’t spend a lot of time agonizing over whether we can afford to buy soap, but it can be a depleting choice in rural India. Dean Spears, an economist at Princeton, offered people in 20 villages in Rajasthan in northwestern India the chance to buy a couple of bars of brand-name soap for the equivalent of less than 20 cents. It was a steep discount off the regular price, yet even that sum was a strain for the people in the 10 poorest villages. Whether or not they bought the soap, the act of making the decision left them with less willpower, as measured afterward in a test of how long they could squeeze a hand grip. In the slightly more affluent villages, people’s willpower wasn’t affected significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Decision fatigue can be a factor in trapping people in poverty:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Spears and other researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major — and hitherto ignored — factor in trapping people in poverty. Because<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">their financial situation forces them to make so many trade-offs, they have less willpower to devote to school, work and other activities that might get them into the middle class</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Glucose restores willpower in humans and dogs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">To establish cause and effect, researchers at Baumeister’s lab tried refueling the brain in a series of experiments involving lemonade mixed either with sugar or with a diet sweetener. The sugary lemonade provided a burst of glucose, the effects of which could be observed right away in the lab; the sugarless variety tasted quite similar without providing the same burst of glucose.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">Again and again, the sugar restored willpower, but the artificial sweetener had no effect.</em><span> </span>The glucose would at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completely reverse it. The restored willpower improved people’s self-control as well as the quality of their decisions: they resisted irrational bias when making choices, and when asked to make financial decisions, they were more likely to choose the better long-term strategy instead of going for a quick payoff.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The ego-depletion effect was even demonstrated with dogs in two studies by Holly Miller and Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky. After obeying sit and stay commands for 10 minutes, the dogs performed worse on self-control tests and were also more likely to make the dangerous decision to challenge another dog’s turf</em>. But a dose of glucose restored their willpower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The results of the experiment were announced in January, during Heatherton’s speech accepting the leadership of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the world’s largest group of social psychologists. In his presidential address at the annual meeting in San Antonio, Heatherton reported that administering glucose completely reversed the brain changes wrought by depletion — a finding, he said, that thoroughly surprised him.<em style="font-style: italic;">Heatherton’s results did much more than provide additional confirmation that glucose is a vital part of willpower; they helped solve the puzzle over how glucose could work without global changes in the brain’s total energy use. Apparently ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays less attention to long-term prospects</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Good decision makers structure their lives so as to conserve willpower:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Good decision making is not a trait of the person, in the sense that it’s always there,” Baumeister says. “It’s a state that fluctuates.” His studies show that people with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend</em>. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,” Baumeister points out.</p>
