	<h2 class="title">Meditation Followup</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">I got tired of reading the book on Vipassana meditation. It&#8217;s mostly nonsense. <p></p> My mostly-certain judgments: <p></p> The idea that &#8220;not caring&#8221; is always the ideal direction is silly. <p></p> The idea of being really aware of what&#8217;s going on in your mind, rather than being driven by emotional repulsion fields, and especially by childish do-not-want! feelings toward the way things really are in relation to you, is beautiful and what I&#8217;ve already always aspired to. <p></p> The idea that actively resting from activity allows training in the above, and/or is more restorative than simply adding extra (quality) sleep time, is unsettled in my mind. I&#8217;ve definitely achieved significant pleasure in resting while being observant of how I feel (meditating, in some sense; but I didn&#8217;t invest a lot of time really following their specific advice so can&#8217;t fairly say how effective it is, except that I don&#8217;t find their advice in general to be well-motivated beyond &#8216;trust us, we spent a lot of time trying different things&#8217;). But that awake-rest is more pleasurable and interesting than real sleep only because I can&#8217;t remember much of what goes on when I&#8217;m asleep. It doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s more physically helpful or even likely to form new insights more effectively. <p></p> I guess in the same way that people may choose to spend time on various drugs, because they can reach different states of mind there, if I wanted variety for variety&#8217;s sake, I might want a few minutes daily of meditation. Whether or not it&#8217;s better on average than the alternatives (sleep or activity), it&#8217;s at least different. <p></p> As an example of things that meditation subtracts time from, other than sleep, I&#8217;ve started &#8216;composing&#8217; music (improvising using a keyboard and instrument samples, really). During this time I&#8217;m not thinking about myself at all. I doubt I&#8217;m improving at anything other than imagining sounds and mapping sounds to the requisite finger movements (it&#8217;s thought that focused practice, and learning in general, may preserve or amplify some global brain attributes, but I doubt anyone&#8217;s proved it). But it feels nice in moderation, and I can&#8217;t say my life would be any better if I meditated instead. Almost any time I&#8217;d be tempted to meditate, I&#8217;m more tempted to perform this (equally pointless) activity. It&#8217;s more rewarding. It&#8217;s true that I could expect to become &#8216;better&#8217; at meditating in some sense, but practicing music offers definitive, and (I&#8217;m not sure how important this is) sharable improvements. <p></p> Of course, I&#8217;m not only picking a single most rewarding activity and sustaining it in every available moment (other than necessities like work/sleep/food/bills). My internal reward diminishes eventually, and during its refractory period, I&#8217;ll do the next thing. That implements a sort of preference for novelty and variety. Also, I have feelings of &#8216;needing to recharge facility X&#8217; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this as well now because I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;ll do something else until I go to sleep or nap, then I&#8217;ll get back to it when rested&#8221;. <p></p> That&#8217;s my explanation of why I don&#8217;t have a meditation habit, even though I never convinced myself that it would be a complete waste of time. <p></p> For sure I disagree with most things that come from a guru-driven (or worse, religion-driven) school, and that includes any sort of meditation instruction I&#8217;ve come across. I think it&#8217;s actually irresponsible to &#8220;try out&#8221; practices and beliefs too whole-heartedly. Once you endorse a set of practices at all, you enlist all your biases to cementing them in you. I do believe in avoiding unnecessary stress, and feeling like you need to continually monitor changes in yourself during such an experiment, in order to avoid passing a point of no return, doesn&#8217;t sound like fun. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m infinitely susceptible to influence, but I am definitely somewhat susceptible to both self-influence and peer pressure.
