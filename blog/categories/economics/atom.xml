    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>Pennsylvania poor may be sitting on the edge of marginal income tax rates of infinity percent. The state should at least make sure that getting a raise doesn't result in lower net pay. You can expect locally-optimizing welfare recipients to stay at the edge of one of the cliffs (undeclared income is a way out, but won't reduce payments taken from the public).</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/10/bad-sound-bad-sign.html">Robin Hanson observes</a> the damage to U.S. society caused by the ease of winning punitive-damages-by-jury. We&rsquo;ve all experienced paranoid corporate hyper-protectiveness &ndash; being ordered off the field in a drizzle because you might slip on the grass and sue (sorry, our insurance contract requires this officiousness!)<p></p></p>

<div>More generally, we should consider whether 'sending a message' is worth all the consequences. I wish policymakers  understood this. But 'raising awareness' usually just makes us feel good. Anyway, supposing you had a sincere-technocrat government (like Clinton's was reputed to be), there's no forum those technocrats could visit to hear sincere and competent analysis - anywhere power takes consultation becomes clogged with what amount to lobbyists, the best of them appearing to offer quality information and reasoning, indistinguishable from the virtuous impartial academics.</div>
