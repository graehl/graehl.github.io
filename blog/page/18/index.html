		<p>It&#8217;s well known that exercise of self-control drains a &#8220;battery&#8221; - studies have shown that a sequence of willpower-taxing tasks become effectively more challenging, and that the obvious alternative explanations don&#8217;t apply - the depleted resource is specific to self-regulation.  One alternative I think should still be examined: repeated demands for self-control which aren&#8217;t commensurately rewarded, should rationally lead to apathy. But at least one study had a real consequence for lack of willpower: subjects overpaid with their own money, so it wasn&#8217;t the case that the tasks and their rewards were merely artificial tokens.</p>
<p></p>  <a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Enjdewa2/baumeisteretaljpers06.pdf">Baumeister et. al</a> survey the evidence that willpower can also be generally improved by practice.  It&#8217;s pretty weak, but if you&#8217;re hoping to self-improve, you can find some reasons to hope.<p></p> 
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Best results were obtained among participants who were assigned to <strong>improve their posture whenever they thought of it</strong>. Other participants <strong>kept track of what they ate</strong>, and these showed some improvement. The group that was assigned to try to improve their mood state whenever they felt bad did not show any benefit from this exercise.</blockquote>
<p><br> But maybe improving your posture or diet builds your willpower reservoir directly (suppose you were to do this due to pleasure in playing a sport, or having someone you love prepare better food for you, or you for them &#8230;).  Still, good news either way (if it&#8217;s easy to improve posture and diet, and it leads to more willpower, fantastic).</p>
<p></p>  <br>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">(Oaten &amp; Cheng, 2004a) enrolled participants in physical exercise programs for 2 months. The exercise programs included weightlifting, resistance training, and aerobics, and each participant received a program designed by a gym staff member specifically suited for him or her. A staggered waiting list control group design was used so that all participants eventually received the exercise program. The hypothesis was that adhering to an exercise program requires self-regulation, and so <strong>2 months of such regular effort</strong> would improve the capacity for self-regulation in general.</blockquote>
<p><br> This substantially reduced the ego depletion (where one challenging self-regulation task decreases performance on another such task immediately following it).  Again, I&#8217;d think it may be physical exercise that improves the willpower battery&#8217;s capacity or usage rate, not the use of willpower in order to perform the exercise (substitute some more fun exercise program, like sex, or a sport the subject enjoys, and see what happens).</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">people who performed the exercise routines became more successful at reducing their cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and caffeine consumption. They ate less junk food and ate more healthy food. They reported improvements in emotional control and a reduction in impulsive spending. They reported studying more and watching less television. Even some domestic habits (e.g., washing dishes instead of leaving them in the sink) also improved across the exercise program</blockquote>
<p>I would explain this with consistency and identity effects, not willpower.  But this is still useful.  Since this was a prospective study with (I assume) no dropouts, we can reasonably guess that the exercise in fact caused this.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">only some of these behaviors could plausibly be directly linked to the exercise itself</blockquote>
<p>If the above survey-based claims of generalized self-control improvement (which were not directly measured).  It&#8217;s obvious that you can&#8217;t separate survey results about whether the respondent has positive qualities from changes in their tendency to signal positive things about themselves (if they exercise, they&#8217;re physically more attractive and perhaps more confident in credibly claiming virtue, and also honestly view themselves as more virtuous).</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Participants signed up for a 4-month program on financial monitoring. Each participant met with the experimenter, individually, at the start, and together they reviewed the participant’s bills and spending habits and devised a personal money management plan. [Through use of diaries and logs], most participants improved substantially in regulating their use of money.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the ego-depletion effect decreased in magnitude after just 1 month of following the budgeting and record-keeping regimen.  And, again, survey responses indicated that people were improving their diet, reducing drug use, cleaning their house, keeping promises, and studying.  This time they measured stress (<a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/%7Escohen/scales.html">PSS</a>), distress (<a href="http://www.mapi-trust.org/test/52-ghq">GHQ</a>), and self-efficacy(<a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/%7Ehealth/selfscal.htm">GSES</a>) also, and there was no significant difference.  Identity/consistency effects can&#8217;t be ruled out, but this is finally doing a pretty good job at indicating that regularly practicing control over some part of your life has a generalized self-control training effect.</p>
<p></p>  Studies showing a reduction in ego-depletion from some non-exercise, non-diet, &#8220;responsible&#8221; self-monitoring intervention do not necessarily make people feel significantly better (students following a structured studying program did feel less stress, but the budgeting exercise left people feeling about the same), and definitely don&#8217;t significantly improve GSES (self-efficacy).  So the improvement is more focused, and it may be fair to call it an improvement in general self-regulation.  One reason for caution: all these studies are by the same folks (Oaten &amp; Cheng) who seem to really like the idea that willpower can be trained.<p></p> <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/33/2/281"> Gailliot et al 2007</a> test ego-depletion by presuming  (evidence from Gordijn et al 2004) that overriding prejudice uses the same willpower resource; the initial task is to talk about a typical day of a particular hypothetical obese or homosexual person, while &#8220;avoiding stereotypes&#8221; (whatever that means - basically, second guess and filter your creativity when it&#8217;s too quintessential, which should be tiring); the follow up task which should suffer from ego-depletion is anagram deciphering performance (anagrams are thought to require executive function, because trying all possibilities is taxing?).  People who showed low in motivation to avoid prejudice did worst on anagrams.  <p></p>  This doesn&#8217;t tell me much because both activities are globally tiring.  Baumeister et al assumes that the thing that&#8217;s tired out is exactly &#8220;willpower&#8221;, which seems questionable to me, unless they also show, as was done with other ego-depletion measures, that performance on other metrics (e.g. arithmetic) wasn&#8217;t also degraded.  Also, they seem to presume that it&#8217;s not the case that the people who tend to be good at inventing non-stereotypically are simply smarter, and thus better at anagrams.  They attribute entirely to ego depletion the difference in performance between the better and worse stereotype-suppressors (the worse ones must be &#8220;trying harder&#8221;).  Very sketchy.<p></p>  The Gailliot willpower-practice exercise was to use the off-hand (non-dominant left/right) for everyday activities: brushing teeth, stirring drinks, computer mousing, carrying, eating, opening doors, etc. Also explored was verbal self regulation: avoid slang (e.g. &#8220;yes&#8221; not &#8220;yeah&#8221;), don&#8217;t start sentences with &#8220;I&#8221;, and don&#8217;t curse. Both exercises (followed for 2 weeks) gave an improvement in anagram performance compared to the no-exercise group, but only for those who had trouble with the stereotype suppression exercise. Perhaps this gives some evidence that the anagram task really does measure ego depletion. Perhaps this means that the only people who benefit from willpower training are those who have an unusually low amount of practice exercising it; or it may only mean that the draining preliminary task (making up a story) is just really easy for some people, so their willpower might have improved from the exercises, but the test wasn&#8217;t challenging enough to show any difference.<p></p>  My largest objection to this area of research is that there&#8217;s no proposed physical mechanism or detection of these purported changes. I don&#8217;t need that kind of evidence to believe something about human behavior, but it&#8217;s extremely easy to draw the wrong conclusions from purely behavioral studies.  <p></p>  My next objection is that the control groups (who are assigned NO regular exercises) are poorly designed given that the followup ego-depletion test is a repeat of the initial one; those who are assigned exercises are often remembering the ego-depletion test; the control group is never reminded at all.  So the control group isn&#8217;t controlling for task-specific learning/priming effects (you can definitely learn or refresh memories by visualizing/reviewing, not only by doing).<p></p>  Summary: I now believe (70% likely) that people who are easily ego-depleted can train to become significantly more normal, if they&#8217;re able to institute some self-regulation habits over a long period of time (2 weeks or more).  It&#8217;s unknown (50% likely) whether people who already have regular self-regulation exercise can benefit from more volume or intensity in that area.  Also, (60% likely) improvements in exercise and diet (I would guess sleep also) may give better ego-depletion capacity, supplementary the fact that applying them involves exercise of self-regulation.<p></p>  I have no idea if habits that involve self-monitoring and adjustment, that are easy to follow because they&#8217;re immediately rewarding or self-image-enhancing, are just as good for willpower training as things that are subjectively grueling and painful. I definitely won&#8217;t embark on any heroic efforts in that direction without stronger evidence; what I will do is ensure that I&#8217;m regularly working on changing something in my life (whatever seems most productive at the time).<p></p>  There&#8217;s also some evidence that <a href="http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Elchang/material/Evolutionary/Brain/Self-control%20relies%20on%20glucose%20as%20a%20limited%20energy%20source%20willpower%20Is%20more%20than%20a%20metaphor.pdf">willpower can be buttressed with sugar</a> (the brain needs glucose):<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #403838; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: italic; font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: inherit; text-align: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively.</em></span></span></blockquote>

He was regaling me with a story about making breakfast in high school and covering the dog with pancake mix. He got to the end of the story (which was funnier than you might think) when his brother piped in. &#8220;Great story,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but that was me, not you. You were on the sofa watching.&#8221; The next 20 minutes devolved into an argument over whose life it really was.</p> <p>I had forgotten about that story until I read a paper in the September 2010 issue of</p>
<p></p>
<em>Psychological Science</em><p></p>by Isabel Lindner, Gerald Echterhoff, Patrick Davidson, and Matthias Brand. They were interested in how observing actions influences your memory for those actions. <p>Previous research has shown that if people imagine performing an action, they can later believe that they did it. I know I have had this happen to me. I have thought about bringing the garbage can to the street on the day when garbage is collected. Later, I am surprised that it isn&#8217;t out on the street; I mis-remembered thinking about taking out the garbage as actually taking it out.</p> <p>These authors were interested in whether observing an action can lead you to think later that you actually performed it. To test this possibility, they first had people read about a variety of simple actions like shaking a bottle or tapping with a pencil for 15 seconds. Some of the actions they only read about, while others they read about and also performed.</p> <p>After a short break, people saw videos of other people carrying out some actions they actually performed, some they just read about, and some that were not a part of the first phase of the experiment at all.</p> <p>Two weeks later, the participants were shown a list of actions and were asked whether they had performed them in the first session of the study.</p> <p>Across three studies, people were consistently more likely to believe that they had performed actions that they had only seen someone else perform than actions they had not seen someone else perform. That is, watching someone else perform an action led people to believe later that they themselves had performed the action. This finding held up even when participants were told at the beginning of the study to pay careful attention to the actions they performed.</p> <p>In a particularly interesting condition, this finding was observed even when participants were warned that people often mis-remember actions they see other people perform as things they did themselves. Knowing about this effect does not make it go away.</p> </div></div></blockquote> He goes on to speculate in a way I can&#8217;t fully support, but it&#8217;s still plausible:<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><div style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;"> <p>Why does this happen?</p> <p>As I have written about previously in this blog, when you see someone perform an action, you often adopt the goals of the people you are watching. This phenomenon is called</p>
<p></p>
<em>goal contagion</em>. Goal contagion is useful in social groups, because it can lead an entire group to want to work together. A side effect of this goal contagion, though, is that you may later think you were more involved in an action than you actually were. The most extreme version of this effect is a false memory that you performed an action that you actually did not. <p>Findings like this reinforce the point that our memories are not designed to provide a truthful readout of the events of our lives. Memory is designed to help us act in the future. Seeing an action performed gives you some confidence that you understand how to perform the action yourself. Your memory is really trying to tell you that you understand how to perform an action.</p> </div></div></blockquote>

		      Is it because people are taller than they&#8217;re (on average) more intelligent?  I doubt it.  <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200901/why-men-are-more-intelligent-women">Satoshi Kanazawa claims</a> that the average man is smarter than the average woman, but in same-height populations, the reverse is true.  For sure the same environmental problems that would lead to below-genetic-potential height would also lead to below-genetic-potential intelligence (it&#8217;s well known that much of the variation in intelligence is explained by absence of damage from malnutrition or disease), so I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s necessarily any mystery.  In fact, if a man and woman are the same height, then it&#8217;s likely that the woman grew up in a more health-promoting environment.  However, <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200901/why-are-taller-people-more-intelligent-shorter-people">he disagrees</a>.<p></p>  He <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201010/girls-are-more-intelligent-boys-men-are-more-intelligent-w">explains this data</a> as being caused by height as well:<p></p>  <br> <div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;">

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(found via <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/09/we_are_exposed_to_more_viruses_1.php">http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/09/we_are_exposed_to_more_viruses_1.php</a> ):</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(also, <a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v34/n2/abs/ijo2009224a.html">another study</a> of mostly-fit and all-exercising army adults finds no link between AD36 and obesity)</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The data indicated that for the AD36 Negative group, the ages were 8-11 yrs (18%), 12-15 yrs (65%), and 15-18 yrs (17%). For the AD36 Positive group, the ages were 8-11 yrs (5%), 12-15 yrs (32%), and 15-18 yrs (63%). This is as we surmised above: more older kids are in the AD36 group. The weight average for the AD36 Negative group was 69 kg (+/- 24 kg SD); for the AD36 Positive group is was 93 kg (+/- 24 kg SD).</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Thus, one sure finding is that older kids are heavier: in fact, they were about 24 kg heavier, which translated to about 50 lbs. It is at least good to see that the press release got this figure correct.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Another finding is that older kids are more likely to have been previously infected by AD36, also as we surmised (in two years, you have have plenty of colds).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">There is no modeling of the expected distribution of biometric properties of the two populations (AD36-negative and -positive) given the other statistics (age,sex,race) reported. This is extremely surprising to me.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">However, it&#8217;s not just that older kids (adults, really) weigh more - the size-relative metrics BMI, and waist/height ratio were also higher in the AD36 antibody group. But still, those should be adjusted for age as well; their distribution (and mean) will surely change with age, and definitely will change for the worse with age in the destined-to-be-obese (it takes time to blossom into full adult obesity). The fact that no such adjustment was made means that the study contributes almost no additional evidence, but this could be corrected with a proper analysis. And, supposing the raw data is available, this can happen.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The two populations also have a significant sex difference: the AD36-negative group is 58% male, and the AD36-positive is only 47%. However, it looks like adult men and women have similar recommended BMI and waist/height ratios (actually, women are recommended to have slightly lower) - I don&#8217;t know what the actual averages are. Racially, there&#8217;s a 13% shift from &#8220;non-hispanic white&#8221; to &#8220;hispanic&#8221; in the AD36-positive population. While I don&#8217;t know how different those groups are re: AD36-positivity or BMI etc., this should be considered as well. The age mismatch is definitely the most severe problem.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The &#8220;discussion&#8221; section lists much other work which seems to provide better evidence of a AD36-obesity link (I assume the authors are leaving out any negative results that don&#8217;t support their views). For example:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">[In] a small substudy of adult twins with discordant AD36-specific antibody status, 13 Twins with antibodies to AD36 were noted to have higher BMI values and greater proportions of body fat then their respective antibody-negative twins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(evidence of correlation, not causality - would be quite strong evidence if the number of twins and BMI/body fat mismatch were large enough)</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">infection of nonhuman primates, rodents, and chickens with AD36 increased total body fat independent of energy intake</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(causality in animal models, although i would hope for exposure rather than infection as the trigger - perhaps p(infection|exposure) is high enough that it doesn&#8217;t matter)</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">adipose-derived stem/stromal cells &#8230; infected with AD36 showed increased differentiation and higher levels of lipid accumulation than noninfected control cells</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(causal, but in vitro: doesn&#8217;t guarantee net fattening in the context of a human body)</p>

<em>Psychological Science</em>, Cuddy and coauthors Dana R. Carney and Andy J. Yap of Columbia University detail the results of an experiment in which forty-two male and female participants were randomly assigned to a high- or low-power pose group. No one was told what the study was about; instead, each participant believed it was related to the placement of ECG electrodes above and below his or her heart. <p>Subjects in the high-power group were manipulated into two expansive poses for one minute each: first, the classic feet on desk, hands behind head; then, standing and leaning on one&#8217;s hands over a desk. Those in the low-power group were posed for the time period in two restrictive poses: sitting in a chair with arms held close and hands folded, and standing with arms and legs crossed tightly. Saliva samples taken before and after the posing measured testosterone and cortisol levels. To evaluate risk tolerance, participants were given $2 and told they could roll a die for even odds of winning $4. Finally, participants were asked to indicate how &#8220;powerful&#8221; and &#8220;in charge&#8221; they felt on a scale from one to four.</p> <p>Controlling for subjects&#8217; baseline levels of both hormones, Cuddy and her coauthors found that high-power poses decreased cortisol by about 25 percent and increased testosterone by about 19 percent for both men and women. In contrast, low-power poses increased cortisol about 17 percent and decreased testosterone about 10 percent.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, high-power posers of both sexes also reported greater feelings of being powerful and in charge. In addition, those in the high-power group were more likely to take the risk of gambling their $2; 86 percent rolled the die in the high-power group as opposed to 60 percent of the low-power posers.</p> <p>Previous research established that situational role changes can cause shifts in hormone levels. In primate groups, for example, after an alpha male dies the testosterone levels of the animal replacing him go up. The hormonal shifts measured in this experiment show that such changes can be influenced independent of role, situation, or any consciously focused thoughts about power. The physical poses are enough.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div></blockquote> Does being told to take such poses explain the effect? Does taking the poses voluntarily in solitude preserve the effect? Or is it only taking the pose in an environment where you&#8217;re watched by others?

<br> Background: Growing epidemiological evidence indicates that moderate alcohol consumption<br> is associated with reduced total mortality among middle-aged and older adults. However, the salutary effect of moderate drinking may be overestimated owing to confounding factors. Abstainers<br> may include former problem drinkers with existing health problems and may be atypical compared to drinkers in terms of sociodemographic and social-behavioral factors. The purpose of this<br> study was to examine the association between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality over<br> 20 years among 1,824 older adults, controlling for a wide range of potential confounding factors<br> associated with abstention.<p></p>  Methods: The sample at baseline included 1,824 individuals between the <b>ages of 55 and 65</b>.<br> The database at baseline included information on daily alcohol consumption, sociodemographic<br> factors, former problem drinking status, health factors, and social-behavioral factors. Abstention<br> was deﬁned as abstaining from alcohol at baseline. Death across a 20-year follow-up period was<br> conﬁrmed primarily by death certiﬁcate.<p></p>  Results: Controlling only for age and gender, compared to moderate drinkers, abstainers had<br> a more than 2 times increased mortality risk, heavy drinkers had 70% increased risk, and light<br> drinkers had 23% increased risk. A model <b>controlling for</b> former problem drinking status, existing<br> health problems, and key sociodemographic and social-behavioral factors, as well as for age and<br> gender, <b>substantially reduced the mortality effect for abstainers compared to moderate drinkers</b>.<br> However, even after adjusting for all covariates, <b>abstainers and heavy drinkers continued to show<br> increased mortality risks of 51 and 45%, respectively, compared to moderate drinkers</b>.<p></p>  </blockquote> <br> Also, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1313092/">Animal Kingdom</a> is the best movie I&#8217;ve seen in the last few years.

		      I was excited to see a claim that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1868">NP=PSPACE</a> (<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.1868v1">pdf</a>) on the <a href="http://feedworld.net/toc/">Theory of Computing Blog Aggregator</a>.<p></p>  Unfortunately, Lemma 3 is in error.  A simple counterexample: the QBF &#8220;Ay Ex p(x,y)&#8221; where p(x,y)=&#8221;(x or not(y)) and (not(x) or y)&#8221; is predicted by Lemma 3 to be equivalent to &#8220;Ex x and not(x)&#8221; which is false.  (A means for all, E means exists).  But suppose y is false - then x=false makes p(x,y) true.  Alternatively, let y be true - then x=true makes p(x,y) true.  This means that for all y, there&#8217;s an x such that p(x,y), which is the original QBF.<p></p>  For PSPACE to be in NP, you would need to be able to verify short proofs (of polynomial size and in polynomial time) verifying the correctness of a program&#8217;s output (provided the program uses space bounded by some polynomial of the input size).  That would be amazing.

		<p><br> This is hilarious.  Hand-washing apparently has profound psychological effects, which are usually purported to be metaphorical (&#8220;Out, damn&#8217;d spot!&#8221;).  But this leaves me dying for experimental clarification -what happens to the postdecisional dissonance if the subjects instead:</p>
<p></p>  1) &#8220;wash&#8221; their hands in some staining, sticky, or malodorous substance?<p></p>  2) are told (prior or post ablution) that  the soap was contaminated with some pathogen, so they need to wash again to be safe?<p></p>  3) rub their hands together vigorously without any fluid or soap?
<p>4) play a video game?</p>
<p>(and for longer and shorter durations, of course)</p>

<div class="Abstract" style="padding: 10px 40px 20px 20px; font-weight: bold; color: #333333;">After choosing between two alternatives, people perceive the<sup><span> </span></sup>chosen alternative as more attractive and the rejected alternative<sup><span> </span></sup>as less attractive. This postdecisional dissonance effect was<sup><span> </span></sup>eliminated by cleaning one’s hands. Going beyond prior<sup><span> </span></sup>purification effects in the moral domain, physical cleansing<sup><span> </span></sup>seems to more generally remove past concerns, resulting in ametaphorical &#8220;clean slate&#8221; effect.</div>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-size: small;">Hand washing removes more than dirt—it also removes the<sup><span> </span></sup>guilt of past misdeeds, weakens the urge to engage in compensatory<sup><span> </span></sup>behavior (<a href="#R1" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>1</em></a>), and attenuates the impact of disgust on moral<sup><span> </span></sup>judgment (<a href="#R2" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>2</em></a>). These findings are usually conceptualized in terms<sup><span> </span></sup>of a purity-morality metaphor that links physical and moral<sup><span> </span></sup>cleanliness (<a href="#R3" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>3</em></a>); however, they may also reflect that washing<sup><span> </span></sup>more generally removes traces of the past by metaphorically<sup><span> </span></sup>wiping the slate clean. If so, washing one’s hands may<sup><span> </span></sup>lessen the influence of past behaviors that have no moral implications<sup><span> </span></sup>at all. We test this possibility in a choice situation. Freely<sup><span> </span></sup>choosing between two similarly attractive options (e.g., Paris<sup><span> </span></sup>or Rome for vacation) arouses cognitive dissonance, an aversive<sup><span> </span></sup>psychological state resulting from conflicting cognitions. Peoplereduce dissonance by perceiving the chosen alternative as more<sup><span> </span></sup>attractive and the rejected alternative as less attractive after<sup><span> </span></sup>choice, thereby justifying their decision (<a href="#R4" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>4</em></a>,<span> </span><a href="#R5" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>5</em></a>). We test whether<sup><span> </span></sup>hand washing reduces this classic postdecisional dissonance<sup><span> </span></sup>effect.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-size: small;">In individual sessions as part of an alleged consumer survey,<sup><span> </span></sup>40 undergraduates browsed 30 CD covers as if they were in a<sup><span> </span></sup>music store. They selected 10 CDs they would like to own and<sup><span> </span></sup>ranked them by preference. Later, the experimenter offered them<sup><span> </span></sup>a choice between their fifth- and sixth-ranked CDs as a token<sup><span> </span></sup>of appreciation from the sponsor. After the choice, participants<sup><span> </span></sup>completed an ostensibly unrelated product survey that asked<sup><span> </span></sup>for evaluations of a liquid soap; half merely examined the bottle<sup><span> </span></sup>before answering, whereas others tested the soap by washing<sup><span> </span></sup>their hands. After a filler task, participants ranked the 10<sup><span> </span></sup>CDs again, allegedly because the sponsor wanted to know whatpeople think about the CDs after leaving the store (<a href="#R6" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>6</em></a>).</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-size: small;">Can washing one’s hands attenuate the need to justify<sup><span> </span></sup>a recent choice? Yes (<a href="#F1" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;">Fig. 1</a>). For those who merely examined<sup><span> </span></sup>the soap, the preference for the chosen over the rejected alternative<sup><span> </span></sup>increased from before choice [mean (<em>M</em>) = 0.14 and SD = 1.01]<sup><span> </span></sup>to after choice (<em>M</em><span> </span>= 2.05, SD = 1.96) by an average of 1.9 ranks<sup><span> </span></sup>[<em>F</em>(1, 38) = 20.40,<span> </span><em>P</em><span> </span><span> </span>the standard dissonance effect. In contrast, for those who washed<sup><span> </span></sup>their hands, preferences were unaffected by their decision [before<sup><span> </span></sup>choice,<span> </span><em>M</em><span> </span>= 0.68, SD = 0.75; after choice,<span> </span><em>M</em><span> </span>= 1.00, SD = 1.41;<sup><span> </span></sup><em>F</em><span> </span><span> </span>reduced the need to justify one’s choice by increasing<sup><span> </span></sup>the perceived difference between alternatives [<em>F</em>(1, 38) = 6.74,<sup><span> </span></sup><em>P</em><span> </span>= 0.01, for the interaction of time and hand-washing manipulation].</p>

 <br> A study with a different choice task, cleaning manipulation,<sup><span> </span></sup>and measure replicated this finding (<a href="#R7" style="color: #2e6d8f; text-decoration: underline;"><em>7</em></a>). In individual sessions,<sup><span> </span></sup>85 students responded to an alleged consumer survey about four<sup><span> </span></sup>fruit jams (shown in pictures). They were subsequently offered<sup><span> </span></sup>a choice between two jars as a sign of the sponsor’s appreciation.<sup><span> </span></sup>After their choice, participants completed an ostensibly unrelated<sup><span> </span></sup>product survey about an antiseptic wipe; half merely examined<sup><span> </span></sup>the wipe, whereas others tested it by cleaning their hands.<sup><span> </span></sup>Next, they rated the expected taste of the four jams (0 = notgood at all; 10 = very good).
<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-size: small;">Participants who did not clean their hands after making a choice<sup><span> </span></sup>expected the chosen jam to taste much better (<em>M</em><span> </span>= 8.00, SD =<sup><span> </span></sup>1.65) than the rejected jam (<em>M</em><span> </span>= 6.43, SD = 1.81) [<em>F</em>(1, 83)<sup><span> </span></sup>= 27.54,<span> </span><em>P</em><span> </span><span> </span>attenuated this difference to nonsignificance [for chosen jam,<sup><span> </span></sup><em>M</em><span> </span>= 7.63 and SD = 1.56; for rejected jam,<em>M</em><span> </span>= 7.23 and SD =<sup><span> </span></sup>1.25;<span> </span><em>F</em>(1, 83) = 1.79,<span> </span><em>P</em><span> </span>= 0.19, for the simple effect]. Thus,<sup><span> </span></sup>hand cleaning significantly reduced the classic postdecisional<sup><span> </span></sup>dissonance effect [<em>F</em>(1, 83) = 7.80,<span> </span><em>P</em><span> </span>= 0.006, for the interaction<sup><span> </span></sup>of product and hand-cleaning manipulation].</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px; font-size: small;">These findings indicate that the psychological impact of physical<sup><span> </span></sup>cleansing extends beyond the moral domain. Much as washing can<sup><span> </span></sup>cleanse us from traces of past immoral behavior, it can also<sup><span> </span></sup>cleanse us from traces of past decisions, reducing the need<sup><span> </span></sup>to justify them. This observation is not captured by the purity-morality<sup><span> </span></sup>metaphor and highlights the need for a better understanding<sup><span> </span></sup>of the processes that mediate the psychological impact of physicalcleansing. To further constrain the range of plausible candidate<sup><span> </span></sup>explanations, future research may test whether the observed<sup><span> </span></sup>&#8220;clean slate&#8221; effect is limited to past acts that may threaten<sup><span> </span></sup>one’s self-view (e.g., moral transgressions and potentially<sup><span> </span></sup>poor choices) or also extends to past behaviors with positive<sup><span> </span></sup>implications.</p>
