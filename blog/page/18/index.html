			Saying &#8220;Computer&#8221; Is More Distracting That Tracing Circles on Paper</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>An example of a study that doesn&#8217;t say as much to me as to the researchers:</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">
</span></span><p>does our inner voice help us with impulse control?</p>
<p>To get at this question, the researchers asked people to do several other things while they performed the Go/No-Go task. On some trials, people had to say out loud the word &#8220;computer&#8221; over and over while they did the Go/No-Go task. Because repeating &#8220;computer&#8221; uses the same verbal resources that support our inner voice, it ties up our inner voice so it can&#8217;t function properly. If, our inner voice is important for controlling our impulses (e.g., &#8220;don&#8217;t press the button&#8221;), then it follows that people should perform worse on the Go/No-Go task when they are repeating &#8220;computer&#8221; than when they are not. Of course, to ensure that it is not the addition of any activity that disrupts Go/No-Go task performance, but specifically an activity that prevents folks from wielding the voice in their head, on other trials people performed another activity that was more spatial in nature. People were asked to continuously draw circles on a piece of paper with their non-dominant hand. Like repeating &#8220;computer&#8221; over and over, this circle drawing task is repetitive and requires some attention to do correctly, but importantly, it doesn&#8217;t occupy verbal resources so the inner voice can still function properly.</p>
<p>Compared with the circle-drawing task, repeating &#8220;computer&#8221; resulted in more impulsive responding. People had a greater tendency to make a ‘Go&#8217; response - even when they shouldn&#8217;t have. These results suggest that the inner voice helps us to exert self-control by enhancing our ability to restrain our impulses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">Tullett, A., &amp; Inzlicht, M. (2010). The voice of self-control: Blocking the inner voice increases impulsive responding. Acta Psychologica, 135, 252-256.</span></span></p>
<p></p>  (the task is purely visual-motor, and &#8220;Go&#8221; happens 2/3 of the time, so the mistakes tend to be in that direction)<p></p>  All this says to me is that there&#8217;s a conflict between saying a word, and performing the Go/No-Go task, which is greater than the conflict from a repetitive motion with the left hand.<p></p>  It&#8217;s obvious that some things are distracting. I can&#8217;t listen to someone and read at the same time (understanding both). I can&#8217;t talk freely and read something else at the same time. It&#8217;s also obvious that many people choose to perform some repetitive fidgeting motion while they think. <p></p>  They&#8217;re going to have to get much more creative if they want to convince me they have uncovered some general principle - what they wish they&#8217;d shown is that some of the verbal resources of the brain are recruited for arbitrary rule-following tasks, where an exception to the usual pattern happens enough that the initial tendency has to be overriden.

			Brains Need Water</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      Of course humans need water for many reasons, but I was still impressed by this:<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">Brain cells require a delicate balance between water and various elements to operate, and when you lose too much water, that balance is disrupted. Your brain cells lose efficiency.</span></span></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><div style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;"> <p>Years of research have found that when we&#8217;re parched, we have more difficulty keeping our attention focused. Dehydration can impair short-term memory function and the recall of long-term memory. The ability to perform mental arithmetic, like calculating whether or not you&#8217;ll be late for work if you hit snooze for another 15 minutes, is compromised when your fluids are low.</p> <p>Over the course of a typical twenty-four hour period, the longest spell most of us go without fluid intake is the six to eight hours we spend sleeping. Sleeping is hardly the kind of activity that you sweat over, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not losing water during the night. With every somnolent breath, you expel moisture, and the cumulative effect of a night&#8217;s sleep is to dry out.</p> </div></div></blockquote> according to <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you-illuminated/201010/why-your-brain-needs-water">Joshua Gowin</a>, a neuroscience doctoral student.<p></p>  If the &#8220;delicate balance&#8221; is important, then too much water is probably bad as well.<p></p>  I&#8217;ve experienced a light headache or near-fainting spell after sitting indoors without drinking enough water. I&#8217;m pretty sure that mild dehydration is possible without feeling extremely thirsty.

	<div class="entry-content">
		      Resveratrol has gotten a lot of press as a life-extender, mostly because people love an excuse to consume red wine and dark chocolate. But the expected effect of a heroically resveratrol-heavy diet on humans is <a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/10/08/does_resveratrol_really_work_and_does_srt1720.php">probably so small as to be practically undetectable</a>. Even in concentrated pill form, the quantity that would be equivalent to what extends nematode lifespan by 4% would be difficult to consume (and presently quite expensive).<p></p>  Just enjoy the placebo effect when you munch on your dark chocolate bar and sip your red wine.<p></p>  (thanks, <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/2ug/resveratrol_continues_to_be_useless/">gwern</a>)

			Mitigating Ego Depletion</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>From the <a href="http://bama.ua.edu/%7Esprentic/101%20Baumeister%20et%20al.%202007-self%20control.pdf">paper in the previous post</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">When people expect to have to exert self-control later, they will curtail current performance more severely than if no such demands are anticipated.</blockquote>
<p>Cool.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Consistent with the conservation hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if the stakes are high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion.</blockquote>
<p>I also <a href="">expressed skepticism</a> that experimental subjects were really motivated.</p>
<blockquote>Inducing a state of positive emotion such as humor seems to have that effect [moderating or counteracting the effects of ego depletion] (Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, &amp; Muraven, 2007). Having implementation intentions — formulating ‘‘if–then’’ statements about how to behave in a situation prior to entering it — seems to be effective most likely because such intentions operate as behavioral plans and guidelines that reduce the need for executive control (Webb &amp; Sheeran, 2003). To be sure, none of these procedures clearly counteracts the depleted state in the sense of replenishing the depleted resource. Rather, they may all operate by inducing the person to expend more of the depleted resource. In contrast, there is some reason to think that replenishing glucose in the bloodstream does actually rectify the depletion by restoring the depleted resource (Gailliot et al., 2007).</blockquote>
<p>Having a comprehensive plan in place means you don&#8217;t have to decide anything. Does making such a plan cost as much as making a decision in real time?</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Logical reasoning, extrapolation, and other controlled processes depend on control by the self, and performance on these tasks dips sharply when people are depleted (Schmeichel, Vohs, &amp; Baumeister, 2003).</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what types of items generally used to measure IQ (&#8220;G&#8221;) don&#8217;t ego-deplete.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Recent studies indicate that the same energy is used for effortful decision making, as well as for active rather than passive responses (e.g., Vohs et al., 2007).  These seem to correspond to what laypersons understand as ‘‘free will,’’ namely the ability to override impulses, behave morally, show initiative, and behave according to rational choices (Baumeister, in press).</blockquote>
<p>If I remember this research, contemplating the decision (e.g. imagining consequences) isn&#8217;t depleting; making it is.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Success at building self-control through exercises has been inconsistent.</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Identifying the biological substrates of self-control depletion (and replenishment) would be another helpful direction for further work.</blockquote>
<p>I mentioned this <a href="">earlier</a>.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">people come into the lab, they do one task that drains their willpower, then they get some intervention that might restore their willpower, then they do another task that requires willpower.

			50% Inter-dentist Agreement on Cavities in Xray Photos</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      One of the things I like about my dentist is that she&#8217;ll tell me they think there&#8217;s cavity in xray, and want to wait to see if it goes away or gets worse before treating.  I always thought: weird, can cavities really heal?  Or are they just not sure that it&#8217;s a cavity?<p></p>  From <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130356647">NPR</a>:<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: So imagine: You came to a dentist; you got your X-ray. And then we took your X-ray, and we also gave it to another dentist.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: Right.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: And we <b>asked both dentists to find cavities</b>. And the question is,<b> what would be the match?</b> How many cavities will they find, both people would find in the same teeth?</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: And I&#8217;d really hope it would be somewhere up around 95-plus percent.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: That&#8217;s right. It turns out what <b>Delta Dental tells us is that the probability of this happening is about 50 percent.</b></p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: Fifty percent?</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: Fifty percent, right. It&#8217;s really, really low. It&#8217;s amazingly low. Now, these are not cavities that the dentist finds by poking in and kind of actually measuring one. It&#8217;s from X-rays. Now, <b>why is it so low? It&#8217;s not that one dentist find cavities and one doesn&#8217;t. They both find cavities, just find them in different teeth.</b></p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">(Soundbite of laughter)</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: And here is what happens. Imagine you&#8217;re a dentist, and you see a patient, and you really want to find a cavity because you get paid more if you find cavities and you can fix them. And the patient is already on the chair. He&#8217;s already prepped. You might give them the treatment right now, really good marginal income for you. How is this motivation to find cavities - will influence your ability?</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Now, you look at an X-ray - which is a little fuzzy and unclear, and there are shadows and all kinds of things are happening. What happens is this unclarity of the X-ray helps, in some sense, the dentist to interpret noise as signals, and find cavities where there aren&#8217;t really any.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: And fill them?</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: And fill them, and drill them, expand them. I don&#8217;t think they ever tell their patients, hey, I thought it was a cavity but turns out it was just a mistake.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">(Soundbite of laughter)</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: But they do fill them.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: You&#8217;re describing a very private relationship between patient and dentist.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: Yes.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: You&#8217;re telling us we should, on average, expect our dentist to be getting it wrong on the X-rays, but that&#8217;s not how people feel about their dentists, right?</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: That&#8217;s right. And the dentists actually have a tremendous loyalty. People are really loyal to their dentist, much more than other - medical profession. And I think one of the reason - go back to cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the idea that when people do something painful, they become more committed to the goal. If we have a fraternity and we haze people in a more difficult way, they become more loyal to the fraternity.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">SIEGEL: You have dentistry as a hazing experience right now.</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">Prof. ARIELY: That&#8217;s right. And I think the same thing happen with dentists. Dentistry is basically the unpleasant experience. They poke in your mouth. It&#8217;s uncomfortable. It&#8217;s painful. It&#8217;s unpleasant. You have to keep your mouth open. And I think all of this pain actually causes cognitive dissonance - and cause higher loyalty to your dentist.

Which one would you choose, and how the duration of relationship be affecting that?</p> <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; line-height: 1.35em; font-size: 0.85em;">And it turns out that the more time people have seen the same dentist, the more likely the decision is going to go in favor of the dentist. People are going to go for the treatment that is more expensive but has the same outcome. More out of pocket for them, more money for the doctor. So in this case, loyalty actually creates more benefit for the dentists.</p> </div></div></blockquote>

			Evidence That Self-control Can Be Trained (Like a Muscle)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s well known that exercise of self-control drains a &#8220;battery&#8221; - studies have shown that a sequence of willpower-taxing tasks become effectively more challenging, and that the obvious alternative explanations don&#8217;t apply - the depleted resource is specific to self-regulation.  One alternative I think should still be examined: repeated demands for self-control which aren&#8217;t commensurately rewarded, should rationally lead to apathy. But at least one study had a real consequence for lack of willpower: subjects overpaid with their own money, so it wasn&#8217;t the case that the tasks and their rewards were merely artificial tokens.</p>
<p></p>  <a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Enjdewa2/baumeisteretaljpers06.pdf">Baumeister et. al</a> survey the evidence that willpower can also be generally improved by practice.  It&#8217;s pretty weak, but if you&#8217;re hoping to self-improve, you can find some reasons to hope.<p></p> 
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Best results were obtained among participants who were assigned to <strong>improve their posture whenever they thought of it</strong>. Other participants <strong>kept track of what they ate</strong>, and these showed some improvement. The group that was assigned to try to improve their mood state whenever they felt bad did not show any benefit from this exercise.</blockquote>
<p><br> But maybe improving your posture or diet builds your willpower reservoir directly (suppose you were to do this due to pleasure in playing a sport, or having someone you love prepare better food for you, or you for them &#8230;).  Still, good news either way (if it&#8217;s easy to improve posture and diet, and it leads to more willpower, fantastic).</p>
<p></p>  <br>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">(Oaten &amp; Cheng, 2004a) enrolled participants in physical exercise programs for 2 months. The exercise programs included weightlifting, resistance training, and aerobics, and each participant received a program designed by a gym staff member specifically suited for him or her. A staggered waiting list control group design was used so that all participants eventually received the exercise program. The hypothesis was that adhering to an exercise program requires self-regulation, and so <strong>2 months of such regular effort</strong> would improve the capacity for self-regulation in general.</blockquote>
<p><br> This substantially reduced the ego depletion (where one challenging self-regulation task decreases performance on another such task immediately following it).  Again, I&#8217;d think it may be physical exercise that improves the willpower battery&#8217;s capacity or usage rate, not the use of willpower in order to perform the exercise (substitute some more fun exercise program, like sex, or a sport the subject enjoys, and see what happens).</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">people who performed the exercise routines became more successful at reducing their cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and caffeine consumption. They ate less junk food and ate more healthy food. They reported improvements in emotional control and a reduction in impulsive spending. They reported studying more and watching less television. Even some domestic habits (e.g., washing dishes instead of leaving them in the sink) also improved across the exercise program</blockquote>
<p>I would explain this with consistency and identity effects, not willpower.  But this is still useful.  Since this was a prospective study with (I assume) no dropouts, we can reasonably guess that the exercise in fact caused this.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">only some of these behaviors could plausibly be directly linked to the exercise itself</blockquote>
<p>If the above survey-based claims of generalized self-control improvement (which were not directly measured).  It&#8217;s obvious that you can&#8217;t separate survey results about whether the respondent has positive qualities from changes in their tendency to signal positive things about themselves (if they exercise, they&#8217;re physically more attractive and perhaps more confident in credibly claiming virtue, and also honestly view themselves as more virtuous).</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Participants signed up for a 4-month program on financial monitoring. Each participant met with the experimenter, individually, at the start, and together they reviewed the participant’s bills and spending habits and devised a personal money management plan. [Through use of diaries and logs], most participants improved substantially in regulating their use of money.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the ego-depletion effect decreased in magnitude after just 1 month of following the budgeting and record-keeping regimen.  And, again, survey responses indicated that people were improving their diet, reducing drug use, cleaning their house, keeping promises, and studying.  This time they measured stress (<a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/%7Escohen/scales.html">PSS</a>), distress (<a href="http://www.mapi-trust.org/test/52-ghq">GHQ</a>), and self-efficacy(<a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/%7Ehealth/selfscal.htm">GSES</a>) also, and there was no significant difference.  Identity/consistency effects can&#8217;t be ruled out, but this is finally doing a pretty good job at indicating that regularly practicing control over some part of your life has a generalized self-control training effect.</p>
<p></p>  Studies showing a reduction in ego-depletion from some non-exercise, non-diet, &#8220;responsible&#8221; self-monitoring intervention do not necessarily make people feel significantly better (students following a structured studying program did feel less stress, but the budgeting exercise left people feeling about the same), and definitely don&#8217;t significantly improve GSES (self-efficacy).  So the improvement is more focused, and it may be fair to call it an improvement in general self-regulation.  One reason for caution: all these studies are by the same folks (Oaten &amp; Cheng) who seem to really like the idea that willpower can be trained.<p></p> <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/33/2/281"> Gailliot et al 2007</a> test ego-depletion by presuming  (evidence from Gordijn et al 2004) that overriding prejudice uses the same willpower resource; the initial task is to talk about a typical day of a particular hypothetical obese or homosexual person, while &#8220;avoiding stereotypes&#8221; (whatever that means - basically, second guess and filter your creativity when it&#8217;s too quintessential, which should be tiring); the follow up task which should suffer from ego-depletion is anagram deciphering performance (anagrams are thought to require executive function, because trying all possibilities is taxing?).  People who showed low in motivation to avoid prejudice did worst on anagrams.  <p></p>  This doesn&#8217;t tell me much because both activities are globally tiring.  Baumeister et al assumes that the thing that&#8217;s tired out is exactly &#8220;willpower&#8221;, which seems questionable to me, unless they also show, as was done with other ego-depletion measures, that performance on other metrics (e.g. arithmetic) wasn&#8217;t also degraded.  Also, they seem to presume that it&#8217;s not the case that the people who tend to be good at inventing non-stereotypically are simply smarter, and thus better at anagrams.  They attribute entirely to ego depletion the difference in performance between the better and worse stereotype-suppressors (the worse ones must be &#8220;trying harder&#8221;).  Very sketchy.<p></p>  The Gailliot willpower-practice exercise was to use the off-hand (non-dominant left/right) for everyday activities: brushing teeth, stirring drinks, computer mousing, carrying, eating, opening doors, etc. Also explored was verbal self regulation: avoid slang (e.g. &#8220;yes&#8221; not &#8220;yeah&#8221;), don&#8217;t start sentences with &#8220;I&#8221;, and don&#8217;t curse. Both exercises (followed for 2 weeks) gave an improvement in anagram performance compared to the no-exercise group, but only for those who had trouble with the stereotype suppression exercise. Perhaps this gives some evidence that the anagram task really does measure ego depletion. Perhaps this means that the only people who benefit from willpower training are those who have an unusually low amount of practice exercising it; or it may only mean that the draining preliminary task (making up a story) is just really easy for some people, so their willpower might have improved from the exercises, but the test wasn&#8217;t challenging enough to show any difference.<p></p>  My largest objection to this area of research is that there&#8217;s no proposed physical mechanism or detection of these purported changes. I don&#8217;t need that kind of evidence to believe something about human behavior, but it&#8217;s extremely easy to draw the wrong conclusions from purely behavioral studies.  <p></p>  My next objection is that the control groups (who are assigned NO regular exercises) are poorly designed given that the followup ego-depletion test is a repeat of the initial one; those who are assigned exercises are often remembering the ego-depletion test; the control group is never reminded at all.  So the control group isn&#8217;t controlling for task-specific learning/priming effects (you can definitely learn or refresh memories by visualizing/reviewing, not only by doing).<p></p>  Summary: I now believe (70% likely) that people who are easily ego-depleted can train to become significantly more normal, if they&#8217;re able to institute some self-regulation habits over a long period of time (2 weeks or more).  It&#8217;s unknown (50% likely) whether people who already have regular self-regulation exercise can benefit from more volume or intensity in that area.  Also, (60% likely) improvements in exercise and diet (I would guess sleep also) may give better ego-depletion capacity, supplementary the fact that applying them involves exercise of self-regulation.<p></p>  I have no idea if habits that involve self-monitoring and adjustment, that are easy to follow because they&#8217;re immediately rewarding or self-image-enhancing, are just as good for willpower training as things that are subjectively grueling and painful. I definitely won&#8217;t embark on any heroic efforts in that direction without stronger evidence; what I will do is ensure that I&#8217;m regularly working on changing something in my life (whatever seems most productive at the time).<p></p>  There&#8217;s also some evidence that <a href="http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Elchang/material/Evolutionary/Brain/Self-control%20relies%20on%20glucose%20as%20a%20limited%20energy%20source%20willpower%20Is%20more%20than%20a%20metaphor.pdf">willpower can be buttressed with sugar</a> (the brain needs glucose):<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #403838; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"><em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: italic; font-size: inherit; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: inherit; text-align: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;">Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively.</em></span></span></blockquote>

He was regaling me with a story about making breakfast in high school and covering the dog with pancake mix. He got to the end of the story (which was funnier than you might think) when his brother piped in. &#8220;Great story,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but that was me, not you.

<p></p>
<em>Psychological Science</em><p></p>by Isabel Lindner, Gerald Echterhoff, Patrick Davidson, and Matthias Brand. They were interested in how observing actions influences your memory for those actions. <p>Previous research has shown that if people imagine performing an action, they can later believe that they did it. I know I have had this happen to me. I have thought about bringing the garbage can to the street on the day when garbage is collected. Later, I am surprised that it isn&#8217;t out on the street; I mis-remembered thinking about taking out the garbage as actually taking it out.</p> <p>These authors were interested in whether observing an action can lead you to think later that you actually performed it. To test this possibility, they first had people read about a variety of simple actions like shaking a bottle or tapping with a pencil for 15 seconds. Some of the actions they only read about, while others they read about and also performed.</p> <p>After a short break, people saw videos of other people carrying out some actions they actually performed, some they just read about, and some that were not a part of the first phase of the experiment at all.</p> <p>Two weeks later, the participants were shown a list of actions and were asked whether they had performed them in the first session of the study.</p> <p>Across three studies, people were consistently more likely to believe that they had performed actions that they had only seen someone else perform than actions they had not seen someone else perform. That is, watching someone else perform an action led people to believe later that they themselves had performed the action. This finding held up even when participants were told at the beginning of the study to pay careful attention to the actions they performed.</p> <p>In a particularly interesting condition, this finding was observed even when participants were warned that people often mis-remember actions they see other people perform as things they did themselves. Knowing about this effect does not make it go away.</p> </div></div></blockquote> He goes on to speculate in a way I can&#8217;t fully support, but it&#8217;s still plausible:<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><div style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;"> <p>Why does this happen?</p> <p>As I have written about previously in this blog, when you see someone perform an action, you often adopt the goals of the people you are watching. This phenomenon is called</p>
<p></p>
<em>goal contagion</em>. Goal contagion is useful in social groups, because it can lead an entire group to want to work together. A side effect of this goal contagion, though, is that you may later think you were more involved in an action than you actually were. The most extreme version of this effect is a false memory that you performed an action that you actually did not. <p>Findings like this reinforce the point that our memories are not designed to provide a truthful readout of the events of our lives. Memory is designed to help us act in the future. Seeing an action performed gives you some confidence that you understand how to perform the action yourself. Your memory is really trying to tell you that you understand how to perform an action.</p> </div></div></blockquote>

		      Is it because people are taller than they&#8217;re (on average) more intelligent?  I doubt it.  <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200901/why-men-are-more-intelligent-women">Satoshi Kanazawa claims</a> that the average man is smarter than the average woman, but in same-height populations, the reverse is true.  For sure the same environmental problems that would lead to below-genetic-potential height would also lead to below-genetic-potential intelligence (it&#8217;s well known that much of the variation in intelligence is explained by absence of damage from malnutrition or disease), so I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s necessarily any mystery.  In fact, if a man and woman are the same height, then it&#8217;s likely that the woman grew up in a more health-promoting environment.  However, <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200901/why-are-taller-people-more-intelligent-shorter-people">he disagrees</a>.<p></p>  He <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201010/girls-are-more-intelligent-boys-men-are-more-intelligent-w">explains this data</a> as being caused by height as well:<p></p>  <br> <div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;">

			AD36 (Cold Virus) Exposure Makes You Fat, Maybe</a>

		<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;"><a href="http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=2909" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">Criticisms</a><span> </span>of<span> </span><a href="http://www.isi.edu/%7Egraehl/papers/peds.pdf" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">the recent Gabbert et al AD36obesity paper</a>:</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(found via <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/09/we_are_exposed_to_more_viruses_1.php">http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/09/we_are_exposed_to_more_viruses_1.php</a> ):</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(also, <a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v34/n2/abs/ijo2009224a.html">another study</a> of mostly-fit and all-exercising army adults finds no link between AD36 and obesity)</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The data indicated that for the AD36 Negative group, the ages were 8-11 yrs (18%), 12-15 yrs (65%), and 15-18 yrs (17%). For the AD36 Positive group, the ages were 8-11 yrs (5%), 12-15 yrs (32%), and 15-18 yrs (63%). This is as we surmised above: more older kids are in the AD36 group. The weight average for the AD36 Negative group was 69 kg (+/- 24 kg SD); for the AD36 Positive group is was 93 kg (+/- 24 kg SD).</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Thus, one sure finding is that older kids are heavier: in fact, they were about 24 kg heavier, which translated to about 50 lbs. It is at least good to see that the press release got this figure correct.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Another finding is that older kids are more likely to have been previously infected by AD36, also as we surmised (in two years, you have have plenty of colds).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">There is no modeling of the expected distribution of biometric properties of the two populations (AD36-negative and -positive) given the other statistics (age,sex,race) reported. This is extremely surprising to me.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">However, it&#8217;s not just that older kids (adults, really) weigh more - the size-relative metrics BMI, and waist/height ratio were also higher in the AD36 antibody group. But still, those should be adjusted for age as well; their distribution (and mean) will surely change with age, and definitely will change for the worse with age in the destined-to-be-obese (it takes time to blossom into full adult obesity). The fact that no such adjustment was made means that the study contributes almost no additional evidence, but this could be corrected with a proper analysis. And, supposing the raw data is available, this can happen.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The two populations also have a significant sex difference: the AD36-negative group is 58% male, and the AD36-positive is only 47%. However, it looks like adult men and women have similar recommended BMI and waist/height ratios (actually, women are recommended to have slightly lower) - I don&#8217;t know what the actual averages are. Racially, there&#8217;s a 13% shift from &#8220;non-hispanic white&#8221; to &#8220;hispanic&#8221; in the AD36-positive population. While I don&#8217;t know how different those groups are re: AD36-positivity or BMI etc., this should be considered as well. The age mismatch is definitely the most severe problem.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The &#8220;discussion&#8221; section lists much other work which seems to provide better evidence of a AD36-obesity link (I assume the authors are leaving out any negative results that don&#8217;t support their views). For example:</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">[In] a small substudy of adult twins with discordant AD36-specific antibody status, 13 Twins with antibodies to AD36 were noted to have higher BMI values and greater proportions of body fat then their respective antibody-negative twins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(evidence of correlation, not causality - would be quite strong evidence if the number of twins and BMI/body fat mismatch were large enough)</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">infection of nonhuman primates, rodents, and chickens with AD36 increased total body fat independent of energy intake</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(causality in animal models, although i would hope for exposure rather than infection as the trigger - perhaps p(infection|exposure) is high enough that it doesn&#8217;t matter)</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin: 5px 15px 5px 5px;">
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">adipose-derived stem/stromal cells &#8230; infected with AD36 showed increased differentiation and higher levels of lipid accumulation than noninfected control cells</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">(causal, but in vitro: doesn&#8217;t guarantee net fattening in the context of a human body)</p>

<div style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;"> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Study 1, the scent of women near peak levels of fertility heightened the men’s implicit accessibility to sexual concepts. Study 2 demonstrated that, among men who reported being particularly sensitive to odors, scent cues of fertility triggered heightened perceptions of women’s sexual arousal. Study 3 revealed that in a face-to-face interaction, cues of fertility increased men’s tendency to make risky decisions and to behaviorally mimic a female partner. …</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Whereas women may have been selected to suppress cues of ovulation in order to sustain men’s commitment, men have been selected to identify fertility cues in order to enhance a short-term mating endeavor’s probability of reproductive success. … It is unlikely that all indicators of fertility could be suppressed, because some detectable shifts in hormones are needed to facilitate ovulation. Consequently, men must rely on fairly subtle cues (e.g., changes in scent and skin tone) associated with those hormonal shifts to help them respond adaptively to women’s changing levels of fertility.</p> <p>A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

[2008] … Thornhill and Gangestad argue that [human] women possess two distinct evolved sexualities. One is the “extended sexuality” that women engage in when conception is impossible; the other they call “estrous” sexuality. The former functions to elicit “material beneﬁts” from males, the latter to acquire “good genes” for offspring, and in keeping with these distinct functions, candidate male partners are evaluated on distinct criteria in the two contexts.</p> </blockquote> Cheating happens.  Men are more likely to push for it with a fertile woman, and woman are more likely to desire it when fertile.
