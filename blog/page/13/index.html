<p></p>  cool idea: get teachers to treat students as if they&#8217;re &#8220;gifted&#8221;, and everyone involved tries harder. hard to see a loss there (except to the actual gifted students, who should really get their own &#8220;really gifted - but don&#8217;t tell anyone!&#8221; secret super-gifted program, in fairness).<p></p>

<p>4-6% relative? so the gap went from e.g. 20% to 19%? or absolute? (from 20% to 15%)?</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #5b5b5b; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Nimbus Sans L,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">&#8220;But with high expectations, there is a change in teacher practices and more willingness and interest on their part. Teachers are saying they want more.&#8221;</span></blockquote>
<p>all we need are high expectations.</p>
<p></p>  i wish them all sustained exuberance and effort.

			Incognito, Pt 3</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      Eagleman in <a href="http://jonathan.graehl.org/?tag=Incognito">Incognito</a>, with Mrs. G., recovering from a severe stroke:<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite">When I asked her to close her eyes, she said &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and closed one eye, as in a permanent wink.<br> &#8220;Are your eyes closed?&#8221; I asked.<br> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.<br> &#8220;Both eyes?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> I held up three fingers. &#8220;how many fingers am I holding up, Mrs. G.?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Three,&#8221; she said.<br> &#8220;And your eyes are closed?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> &#8220;Then how did you know how many fingers I was holding up?&#8221;<br> An interesting silence followed </blockquote> <blockquote type="cite">&#8230;<br> I wheeled Mrs. G in front [of a mirror] and asked if she could see her own face. She said yes. I then asked her to close both her eyes. Again she closed one eye and not the other.<br> &#8220;Are <i>both</i> your eyes closed?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> &#8220;Can you see yourself?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> &#8220;Does it seem possible to see yourself in the mirror if both your eyes are closed?&#8221;<br> Pause. <i>No conclusion</i>.<br> &#8220;Does it look to you like one eye is closed or that both are closed?&#8221;<br> Pause. <i>No conclusion</i>.<br> </blockquote> Well, duh. How can she answer that question when both her eyes are closed? :)<p></p>  &#8230;<p></p>  Even though it&#8217;s profitable to model our brains as collections of autonomous semi-intelligent programs, there&#8217;s still coordination. In healthy people, only one motor program runs at once. Half of your body doesn&#8217;t try to eat the cake while the other half tries to restrain it. Half of you doesn&#8217;t run away while the other half fights. Something mediates.<p></p>  It&#8217;s thought that the left hemisphere constantly produces explanations (confabulations) for what we&#8217;re feeling, doing, and seeing. In severely damaged brains (e.g. communication between hemispheres severed completely - always interesting), the explanations (of what the non-connected half of the body is seeing/doing) seem like lies, but really the explaining part has no awareness of the truth, and apparently no shame - always producing the best explanation it can, without admitting failure.

Instead, the moral character of an action’s consequences also seems to influence how non-moral aspects of the action – in this case, whether someone did something intentionally or not – are judged.<sup class="reference" style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Knobe#cite_note-7" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p> </blockquote>  This bit of apparent stupidity is probably more than just an aversion to (publicly) assign credit to people (because it will incline us toward rewarding the person we credit), or a prejudice against CEOs.<p></p>  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6jb/how_to_annoy_misanthropes_and_bleedinghearts/">HT</a>

I always believed this preference to be learned, not innate.<p></p>  Women with a .67-.8 waist:hip ratio are most exciting to men (given a fixed overall slenderness).<p></p>  Dissimilar genes (&#8220;MHC&#8221; - &#8220;histocompatability&#8221;) are identified by scent (by their chemical effects and not directly, I presume) in mice, and lead to sexual preference (presumably because dissimilarity in those genes is important to avoid inbreeding-type recessive defects). Similar receptors exist in humans, and sweaty t-shirts are preferred with increasingly dissimilar MHC.<p></p>  Women prefer the sweaty t-shirts of more physically masculine men when fertile; otherwise they don&#8217;t care as much or can&#8217;t detect it as well.<p></p>  Women tolerate feminine-looking men (e.g. soft, youthful face) relatively more when they&#8217;re less fertile.<p></p>  Women&#8217;s menstrual cycles may change after smelling another woman&#8217;s sweat.<p></p>  Activating vasopressin receptors in the brain causes pair-bonding;polygamous species can be made monogamous and vice versa by manipulating the receptors for vasopressin, or its prevalence. For human males, there&#8217;s already a genetic test (in the area known to code for vasopressin receptors) that predicts infidelity and partners&#8217; dissatisfaction (did they measure vasopressin response directly?)<p></p>  Foxes pair-bond for a single breeding season (the male stays long enough to help raise the kits).

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The researchers theorize that the structure of these shows often involved a child committing an immoral action, the child looking cool and strong, and then at the end of the show the child eventually gets a comeuppance (think Harry Potter, where evil character Draco Malfoy is the coolest and most popular kid in Hogwarts and usually gets away with it, whereas supposedly sympathetic character Ron Weasley is at best a lovable loser who spends most of his time as the butt of Draco&#8217;s jokes). The theory is that children are just not good enough at the whole feedback of conseqeunces thing to realize that the bully&#8217;s comeuppance in the end is supposed to be the inevitable result of their evil ways. All they see is someone being a bully and then being treated as obviously popular and high-status.</p>

<p></p>  Sound and vision are integrated at a low level. Double-beep with single-flash is perceived as double-flash.<p></p>  What gets sent to higher-level processing are differences between expected input and actual input (number of connections sending info from higher-level part to lower-level vision is greater than low-&gt;high). Also e.g. you can&#8217;t tickle yourself. [perhaps this anticipation helps learning precisely timed hand-eye (more generally: motor-sensory) moves as in sports, music, and dance]. Further, decisions, movements, and inputs are shifted (after learning) so that causally-connected inputs+decisions are perceived as happening at the same time (they&#8217;re not; different senses have different lags). e.g. if a button-&gt;flash mechanism has a 1/10 sec delay, you&#8217;ll adjust and feel that the light comes on at the same time as you push the button; remove the delay, and then on your next push you think the light came before the push.<p></p>  More visually-salient events (a larger/brighter/moving square) are perceived as longer duration.<p></p>  Implicit learning: e.g. unconscious (visual) learning: experts at sexing day old chickens, or spotting German vs. British planes in WWII, are clueless to describe the features they use. But after weeks of teaching by example (student gets the same view, guesses yes/no, is corrected by expert) most people can learn.<p></p>  People who can&#8217;t recall any new memories learn the skill of Tetris exactly as well as normal people; their dreams are also filled with falling blocks, although they won&#8217;t remember that they came from a game they were playing.<p></p>  Liking those who are like you: if Rasputin shares your birthday, you describe him in more favorable terms. If something or someone has a similar name, you like them more. Weird. Presumably there&#8217;s some innate same-physical-type (obviously including race, maybe sex) respect or liking as well. First-letter match of name matters for profession, mate, etc. and first-sound or first-few-letters is even stronger.<p></p>  Priming/exposure: even though you don&#8217;t remember seeing something recently, you&#8217;re more likely to recall it (e.g. look at your word choices). If you&#8217;ve seen a face before, you&#8217;ll find it more attractive than if it&#8217;s new (stranger danger?) If you&#8217;ve heard a claim before (even if you judged it dubious or false the first time), you&#8217;re more likely to think it&#8217;s true the second time (possibly part of you remembers that it&#8217;s familiar and that&#8217;s weak evidence for its validity; this seems reasonable to me, and of course that vote can be overwhelmed if you remember specific strong reasons against it).<p></p>  Association: standard advertising tricks.<p></p>  Hunches: shuffled decks of cards with win/lose (money) outcomes; you know some are more favorable than others. You&#8217;ll take 25 draws before you&#8217;ll say which decks are good, but you have sweaty hands drawing from a bad deck by the 13th draw.<p></p>  Soliciting hunch-feelings: if you&#8217;re not self-aware, flip a coin to decide. If, seeing the result, you think letting the coin decide is stupid, your hunch was for the opposite. If you go along with the coin, then you had no strong hunch to the contrary. That&#8217;s why telling someone &#8220;flip a coin to decide&#8221; after they&#8217;ve reached an impasse is useful advice (if they don&#8217;t follow it perfectly).<p></p>  Brains of experts are faster and more energy efficient (in their expert skill, of course) than people who are worse. We can speculate that they were spending more energy while learning (and consciously coaching themselves, or listening to coaching). People who learned Tetris well exhibited this pattern (eventually: electrically quiet brain; skill burned into [low-level?] efficient brain circuits). This is why experts can sometimes choke under pressure; they start interfering by trying to consciously control what&#8217;s become implicit.

</span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">One of the things that has always baffled me about psychedelics such as LSD, LSA or psilocybin (the active ingredient of &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221;) is that their actions seem far too specific to be caused by a simple substance.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The effect I am referring to is that for some people and in some contexts, they cause what is often called a spiritual experience, i.e., experience that is deeply meaningful to the user and possibly long-term world-view (and behaviour) altering.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Look for example at<span> </span><a href="http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6693" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">this study</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">There&#8217;s also this<span> </span><a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00302744?order=1" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">active study</a><span> </span>which is the object of a 12 minute report available<span> </span><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;oi=video_result&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJASWFASqcps&amp;ei=ohL2SdRkxtH5BrWrpboP&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGfD7vagWcpQFE_nuMFaqnHCyvmA&amp;sig2=FMfu2nfKluLCnHFdkTTTYQ" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">on Youtube</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">From my limited experience, and from what I observed in friends, I would say that psychedelics can be used to increase rationality, specifically by eliminating those sources of irrationality stemming from self-deception. They seem to allow the reexamination of deeply ingrained beliefs about the self and the world, that are beyond everyday reach.</p>

<p>Good objection. But those people are brain-damaged. Maybe in normal people the insight will stick. If you try it, videotape yourself, just in case you revert.</p>

Ice cold water, 60 ml total, is introduced into one ear canal using a syringe. This is repeated in the other ear canal.</span></blockquote>

			Chewing Gum Increases Alertness</a>
	</h2>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">
</span><blockquote>
<p><strong>Effects of chewing gum on cognitive function, mood and physiology in stressed and non-stressed volunteers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RATIONALE</strong>:</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that chewing gum may improve aspects of cognitive function and mood. There is also evidence suggesting that chewing gum reduces stress. It is important, therefore, to examine these two areas and to determine whether contextual factors (chewing habit, type of gum, and personality) modify such effects.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>:</p>
<p>The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine whether chewing gum improved mood and mental performance; (ii) to determine whether chewing gum had benefits in stressed individuals; and (iii) to determine whether chewing habit, type of gum and level of anxiety modified the effects of gum.</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:</strong></p>
<p>A cross-over study involving 133 volunteers was carried out. Each volunteer carried out a test session when they were chewing gum and without gum, with order of gum conditions counterbalanced across subjects. Baseline sessions were conducted prior to each test session. Approximately half of the volunteers were tested in 75 dBA noise (the stress condition) and the rest in quiet. Volunteers were stratified on chewing habit and anxiety level. Approximately, half of the volunteers were given mint gum and half fruit gum. The volunteers rated their mood at the start and end of each session and had their heart rate monitored over the session. Saliva samples were taken to allow cortisol levels (good indicator of alertness and stress) to be assayed. During the session, volunteers carried out tasks measuring a range of cognitive functions (aspects of memory, selective and sustained attention, psychomotor speed and accuracy).</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong>:</p>
<p>Chewing gum was associated with greater alertness and a more positive mood. Reaction times were quicker in the gum condition, and this effect became bigger as the task became more difficult. Chewing gum also improved selective and sustained attention. Heart rate and cortisol levels were higher when chewing which confirms the alerting effect of chewing gum.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>:</p>
<p>Overall, the r<strong>esults suggest that chewing gum produces a number of benefits that are generally observed and not context-dependent.</strong><span> </span>In contrast to some previous research, chewing gum failed to improve memory. Further research is now required to increase our knowledge of the behavioral effects of chewing gum and to identify the underlying mechanisms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe cortisol goes up with any physical activity.</p>
<p>Chewing gum might be bad for you in other ways (e.g. possible jaw RSI).</p>
<p>The improved focus and mood works under the quiet or the distressingly-loud-noise condition.</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~graehl/papers/null.multivitamin.pdf">study</a></p>
<p>The 1.07 hazard ratio (7% higher chance of dropping dead at any moment) for men is indeed not significant; a simpler model that doesn&#8217;t control for as many things (including use of some single supplement e.g. selenium) gives a HR=.99, for example.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s unlikely that vitamins do nothing. Yet they appear to, in this fairly large study of old people. I&#8217;d say this is reason to look at fine-tuning vitamin/mineral intake. Those men who took 1-6/week instead of 1x or 2x/day seemed to fare slightly better than 0/week (TOTALLY not significant though).<p></p>  Too much of some things in diet+multivitamin is likely quite harmful to health. If you ignore statistical significance, the weak evidence is that those old people who take multivitamins for a 5 year stretch are slightly more likely to end up dead 10-15 years later.<p></p>  Or, supposing that multivitamins aren&#8217;t harmful (they obviously vary tremendously in composition), it&#8217;s really true that it&#8217;s unlikely that your normal diet is lacking anything you need, and the non-significant effect is mostly due to confounds like taking vitamins because you feel your health start to fail, or taking vitamins because you live a healthy lifestyle already, etc.<p></p>  Unfortunately, that multivitamins do nothing, or are both helpful and harmful, with the harms slightly outweighing the benefits, is the simplest explanation of many such null results in the literature. But I don&#8217;t want to accept it, because I know of some specific causal evidence suggesting that individual vitamins, when supplemented, yield health benefits in a majority of people. So I&#8217;ll hold the slightly more complicated: &#8220;most multivitamins are too-highly dosing at least a few things, in a way that harms health as much as the rest of it benefits health&#8221;, tentatively.<p></p>  Another nearly siginificant pattern: people who&#8217;ve used vitamins for at least 5 years die less than those who recently started or never used (but again, not really significant). Motivated speculation (not wanting to believe multi-vitamins are actually net-harmful or -useless): old people who suddenly start taking multivitamins did so due to correctly feeling their declining health and imminent death. So their higher rate of death shouldn&#8217;t be blamed on having recently started multivitamins.

<p></p>  (sadly: of insects, not humans. humans take too long to die?)<p></p>  Most animals will keep eating until they have enough protein. In some insects, they&#8217;ll eat up to the level that shortens their lifespan but increases their reproductive output.<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>increasing the ratio of protein and non-protein energy in the diet decreases lifespan</strong>; but as seen in the example from male crickets discussed above, if this ratio falls too far there is an increased risk of decreased longevity associated with obesity</span></blockquote>
<p>uh-oh. i like my high-protein diet. i need muscles to do well in soccer and volleyball. and it&#8217;s easy not to overeat when you&#8217;re not craving protein. this suggests a benefit from titrating protein somehow (being sensitive to how much of it you need for your activity level).</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">protein intake is more strongly regulated than that of carbohydrate and fat [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v1/n10/full/100098.html#bibl_20" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; color: #4074c8;">20</a>]. As a result, protein appetite drives overconsumption of energy on low percent protein diets, promoting obesity and metabolic disorders with consequent effects on longevity</span></blockquote>
<p>so, be skinny, on as little protein as you can get away with (obviously you&#8217;ll die with 0 protein in your diet; likewise with 0 fat).</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">the major causes of increased longevity in studies on calorically restricted primates (most recently [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v1/n10/full/100098.html#bibl_30" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; color: #4074c8;">30</a>]) is a reduction in the incidence of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease relative to ad libitum fed controls. This may not result from benefits associated with CR per se, but rather reflect the costs of nutrient imbalance when feeding ad libitum on a fixed diet. As the required balance of nutrients changes over time (with time of day, season, growth and development, and senescence), animals will be forced to overeat some nutrients to gain enough of others</span></blockquote>
<p>speculation without evidence - they seem to be suggesting that ideally you eat the minimum amount of food necessary for all vitamin / macronutrient needs. but it&#8217;s also true that if you have excess body fat, you&#8217;ll survive surgery better. some excess makes you more robust. we can&#8217;t really titrate perfectly.</p>
<p></p>  i suppose the overall question would be: how much quality of life do you have to sacrifice by risking insufficient intake of various nutrients, in order to maybe live longer? nobody knows the answer for humans, yet.<p></p>

<p>yes, perhaps. i hope not, but it needs to be studied - how sensitive is the curve? how &#8220;too much&#8221; can you do while barely reducing lifespan?</p>

On the other hand, it&#8217;s nice for removing uranium from the body. It also reduces colon cancer. It penetrates the brain and can protect neurons there by chelating iron (which I guess you don&#8217;t want in the brain - iron does get in there somehow and exacerbates many brain diseases).<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Grain consumption has long been known to damage vitamin D status and bone health. Indeed, it is difficult to induce bone frailty in laboratory animals without feeding them grain. In Edward Mellanby’s original experiments leading to the discovery of vitamin D, he induced rickets by feeding dogs a diet of oats or wheat bread. [3] In human infants, wheat bran induces rickets. [4] In addition to interfering with vitamin D, grains also contain high levels of <b>phytic acid, which interferes with bone mineralization by blocking absorption of calcium and magnesium.</b></span></blockquote> <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=119">source</a> (while making fun of Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s ridiculous macrobiotic diet)<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Another crucial factor in bone health is vitamin K2. Since dairy fats are the leading source of vitamin K2, it’s likely Ms. Paltrow was deficient in this crucial vitamin.

Almonds and sesame seeds are very high in it; toasting them might help.<p></p>  It seems like you can benefit from moderate phytic acid (nullifying iron in your brain sounds good), by simply ensuring you have excess of the minerals it chelates and steals from you.

<p></p>  You need DHA in your diet (EPA can be synthesized from ALA, which is in flaxseed oil; DHA barely can). But high levels of polyunsaturated fats may be dangerous; they&#8217;re easily oxidized (anecdotal evidence; natural diets don&#8217;t have high levels, unless they&#8217;re mostly fish):<p></p>  You can supplement DHA from some particular type of seaweed (I forget the details), or in many fatty fish or their extracted oil (watch your mercury). It does occur naturally in lesser quantities in various other foods. DHA lowers testosterone, but it has many good effects. Lower testosterone means more (harmless, operable) prostate cancer, but possibly more frequent severe cases:<p></p>

Another reason to eat a high-fat diet.</span></blockquote>
<p>(the ratio matters; eat more saturated fat to mitigate the harms while still getting some of the benefits of DHA)</p>

</span><p>Most Americans eat far too much omega-6, and their omega-6 to omega-3 tissue ratio is too high, which is pro-inflammatory via the COX-2 pathway. Eating omega-3s including DHA reduces inflammation by downregulating the COX-2 pathway. This accounts for the well-attested benefits of DHA against cardiovascular disease. Now, cancer is promoted by COX-2 pathway inflammation, which is why COX-2 inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen are protective against cancer. [4] DHA’s action to downregulate this pathway must generate an anti-cancer effect. But, unlike aspirin and ibuprofen, DHA has no observable effect on overall cancer risk. This suggests that<span> </span><strong><em>DHA has other effects, unrelated to its anti-inflammatory activity, that are cancer promoting</em></strong>. These counterbalance the benefits from its anti-inflammatory effect. If DHA has pro-angiogenic effects that are independent of COX-2 mediated inflammation, then this could account for the observations.</p>
<p>One reason an association of DHA with high-grade cancer may have been missed is that it would be detected only in large studies able to segregate cancers by grade.</p>

<p>AMD = why 1/3 of people 75+ yr old are nearly blind. DHA is the only cause of CEP. It&#8217;s caused by excessive growth of blood vessels dislodging the retina. DHA is concentrated near the retina (is 80% of the PUFA in it). Photons cause oxidation, and DHA is extremely oxidizable. Antioxidants help slow AMD. Finally, adding CEP directly to mice causes AMD (this was shown in 2003). (we know now it&#8217;s because CEP causes angiogensis).</p>
<p></p>  CEP is normally good. It brings immune cells from bone marrow to the wound. Cancers and AMD give chronic CEP elevation. CEP actually causes wound healing even in mice with normal wound healing mechanisms crippled (VEGF and TLR2 knocked-out or inhibited) - this was shown in 2010. VEGF causes angiogenesis when tissue is oxygen deprived. TLR2 causes angiogenesis when it detects oxidative stress.<p></p>  vitamin A + DHA yield CEP (via retinyl from A + HOHA=oxidized DHA).<p></p>  If you&#8217;re going to take DHA (usually fish oil) you&#8217;ll want anti-oxidants. Oxidation can&#8217;t be avoided; it&#8217;s essential to metabolism and fighting infection.<p></p>

Moderate omega-3 consumption is especially important for those suffering from diseases of pathological angiogenesis – especially cancer. DHA is essential for good health – but in excess, it is probably dangerous.</span></blockquote>

</span><p><span> </span>Observational studies weakly link high DHA, high vitamin A, and low antioxidant status to diseases of angiogenesis such as cancer.</p>
<p>This pattern would be consistent with the idea that the natural pathway used in wound healing to trigger angiogenesis – DHA oxidation and combination with retinyl protein to trigger TLR-2 pathways – is also important for cancer progression.</p>
<p>It suggests a strategy of reduced fish oil and vitamin A consumption and increased intake of certain antioxidants (such as lycopene, zinc, selenium, or NAC) may be helpful against cancer.</p>
<p>However, this idea needs testing. No study in animal cancer models has tested this dietary combination.</p>
<p>Given the many proven benefits of moderate amounts of fish oil, I don’t see a reason yet to alter our recommendation that healthy people should eat a pound of fish per week. That said, I do think very high intakes of fish or fish oil are ill advised. And I’m intrigued by the idea that dietary changes may have the potential to play a powerful role in recovery from diseases of angiogenesis such as cancer.</p>

This made big difference for about 3 months, then seemed to not work any more. I talked to a nutritionist friend and she pointed out that according to Andrew Stoll (The Omega 3 Connection) you must take 1000 mg vit C and 500 iu vit E daily or the omega 3 becomes oxidised in your body (cell membranes) and ineffective. I started taking both and in days was back to the original anti-inflammatory effectiveness of omega 3. I have since talked to others about this – for example a psychiatrist whose clients did well on omega 3 for 3 months and then it became ineffective.</span></blockquote>
<p>quite anecdotal - needs actual research. but the fact that omega-3 are easily oxidized means they might degrade vit-C (which means you need enough carbs+selenium in your diet to move the DHAA out of the bloodstream into cells for reconversion to C, or you just need to bear the harm of DHAA and supplement more C. In general, vit E supplementation is quite harmful. I wouldn&#8217;t do it unless strong evidence revealed that it&#8217;s okay when you have high omega-3 intake.</p>
