			non-REM Sleep May Renormalize Synapse Strength</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		(not yet studied in mammals)<p></p>
<div>The ratio of the strength of a synapse between neurons and the total potential (from all incoming synapses) needed to activate a neuron may be all that figures; the absolute values may not be important (this is the basis for computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>, though temporal effects, firing rates, and who knows what else also matter in real brains).</div> <p></p>
<div>So you can renormalize (multiply by some constant 1) and see almost no difference except for perhaps greater susceptibility to noise. But at least the amount of physical material needed is smaller, and the energy needed is smaller. It&#8217;s more efficient.</div> <p></p>
<div>In flies and other simple animals studied so far, this definitely happens during sleep. Maybe it happens in humans also. (remains to be studied).</div>
<p></p>
<div>In any case, be careful committing to some REM-sleep only 3hr/day-with-naps sleep schedule, just because you may feel fine at first, when the exact utility of non-REM sleep isn&#8217;t completely known.</div> <p></p>

			More Research on Willpower</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Baumeister has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313659075&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> coming out on willpower. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">NYTimes article</a> about his work, summarized and discussed on <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/75s/link_nytimes_essay_on_willpower_based_on_an/">LessWrong</a>.</p>
<p></p>  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://graehl.org/tag/willpower">previously discussed</a> much of this. But some of it is new research.<p></p>  It&#8217;s still possible that the only thing being depleted is glucose available to the brain (which is most readily available from stored liver glycogen, or food). But there may be other chemical resources involved. In any case, weighing and making choices taxes the brain; I&#8217;m not sure how much more or less than e.g. solving puzzles or reading and thinking critically.<p></p>  Quoting from the LessWrong summary:<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">
</span><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">You spend the most willpower when you have to make AND implement your decisions:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">which phase of the decision-making process was most fatiguing? To find out, Kathleen Vohs, a former colleague of Baumeister’s now at the University of Minnesota, performed an experiment using the self-service Web site of Dell Computers. One group in the experiment carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of various features available for a computer — the type of screen, the size of the hard drive, etc. — without actually making a final decision on which ones to choose. A second group was given a list of predetermined specifications and told to configure a computer by going through the laborious, step-by-step process of locating the specified features among the arrays of options and then clicking on the right ones. The purpose of this was to duplicate everything that happens in the postdecisional phase, when the choice is implemented.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The third group had to figure out for themselves which features they wanted on their computers and go through the process of choosing them; they didn’t simply ponder options (like the first group) or implement others’ choices (like the second group). They had to cast the die, and that turned out to be the most fatiguing task of all. When self-control was measured, they were the one who were most depleted, by far</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you reluctant to make trade-offs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Once you’re mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren’t a lot of protracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability and therefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call a cognitive miser, hoarding your energy.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">If you’re shopping, you’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best</em><span> </span>(an especially easy strategy if someone else is paying). Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers who know how to time their sales, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experiments involving tailored suits and new cars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you more likely to take the path of least resistance:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">As they started picking features, customers would carefully weigh the choices, but<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">as decision fatigue set in, they would start settling for whatever the default option was. And the more tough choices they encountered early in the process — like going through those 56 colors to choose the precise shade of gray or brown — the quicker people became fatigued and settled for the path of least resistance by taking the default option.</em><span> </span>By manipulating the order of the car buyers’ choices, the researchers found that the customers would end up settling for different kinds of options, and the average difference totaled more than 1,500 euros per car (about $2,000 at the time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Testing willpower depletion in rural Indian villages:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Most of us in America won’t spend a lot of time agonizing over whether we can afford to buy soap, but it can be a depleting choice in rural India. Dean Spears, an economist at Princeton, offered people in 20 villages in Rajasthan in northwestern India the chance to buy a couple of bars of brand-name soap for the equivalent of less than 20 cents. It was a steep discount off the regular price, yet even that sum was a strain for the people in the 10 poorest villages. Whether or not they bought the soap, the act of making the decision left them with less willpower, as measured afterward in a test of how long they could squeeze a hand grip. In the slightly more affluent villages, people’s willpower wasn’t affected significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Decision fatigue can be a factor in trapping people in poverty:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Spears and other researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major — and hitherto ignored — factor in trapping people in poverty. Because<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">their financial situation forces them to make so many trade-offs, they have less willpower to devote to school, work and other activities that might get them into the middle class</em>.</p>

<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">To establish cause and effect, researchers at Baumeister’s lab tried refueling the brain in a series of experiments involving lemonade mixed either with sugar or with a diet sweetener. The sugary lemonade provided a burst of glucose, the effects of which could be observed right away in the lab; the sugarless variety tasted quite similar without providing the same burst of glucose.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">Again and again, the sugar restored willpower, but the artificial sweetener had no effect.</em><span> </span>The glucose would at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completely reverse it. The restored willpower improved people’s self-control as well as the quality of their decisions: they resisted irrational bias when making choices, and when asked to make financial decisions, they were more likely to choose the better long-term strategy instead of going for a quick payoff.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The ego-depletion effect was even demonstrated with dogs in two studies by Holly Miller and Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky. After obeying sit and stay commands for 10 minutes, the dogs performed worse on self-control tests and were also more likely to make the dangerous decision to challenge another dog’s turf</em>. But a dose of glucose restored their willpower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The results of the experiment were announced in January, during Heatherton’s speech accepting the leadership of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the world’s largest group of social psychologists. In his presidential address at the annual meeting in San Antonio, Heatherton reported that administering glucose completely reversed the brain changes wrought by depletion — a finding, he said, that thoroughly surprised him.<em style="font-style: italic;">Heatherton’s results did much more than provide additional confirmation that glucose is a vital part of willpower; they helped solve the puzzle over how glucose could work without global changes in the brain’s total energy use. Apparently ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays less attention to long-term prospects</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Good decision makers structure their lives so as to conserve willpower:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Good decision making is not a trait of the person, in the sense that it’s always there,” Baumeister says. “It’s a state that fluctuates.” His studies show that people with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend</em>. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,” Baumeister points out.</p>

			Narcissistic Leaders Impress but Actually Suck</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		   In an artificial situation where everyone&#8217;s input was valuable, narcissists were seen as more impressive leaders but failed to drive a good decision - probably not bothering to encourage information sharing.<p></p>  Perhaps narcissists value social dominance more than they value group effectiveness (and are more talented at exerting it). Perhaps everyone would value it more if they thought they could claim it, but likely narcissists have acquired a stronger appetite for dominance. So, the experimenters should have offered a large financial incentive for good performance; an intelligent narcissist would then do nothing but persuade people to share information efficiently, and make sure he got credit for doing it.<p></p>  Outside the lab, people who succeed in impressing people probably on average are right to value less the input and judgment of less successful people.<br> <blockquote type="cite">
<div style=""> <blockquote> <p>Although they are generally perceived as arrogant and overly dominant, narcissistic individuals are particularly skilled at radiating an image of a prototypically effective leader. As a result, they tend to emerge as leaders in group settings. Despite people’s positive perceptions of narcissists as leaders, it was thus far unknown if and how leaders’ narcissism is related to the actual performance of those they lead. In the current paper we used a hidden profile paradigm to provide evidence for a discord between the positive image of narcissists as leaders and the reality in terms of group performance. We proposed and found that although narcissistic leaders are perceived as effective due to their displays of authority, leaders’ narcissism actually inhibits information exchange between group members and thereby negatively affects group performance. Our findings thus indicate that perceptions and reality can be at odds, which has important practical and theoretical implications.</p> </blockquote> <p>The study is based on the</p>

Researchers recruited 150 people and put them into groups of three. One person was randomly chosen as the group’s leader, and each group was assigned a task: choosing a job candidate. Everyone was told they could contribute advice, but the leader was ultimately responsible for making the decision. Of 45 items of information about the candidate, some were given to all three, and some to only one of the participants. <p>From the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Sharing all the information, including what each possessed exclusively, would lead to the best choice. Afterwards, the participants completed questionnaires. The leaders’ questions measured narcissism; the others assessed the leaders’ authority and effectiveness. All checked off the items among the 45 that they knew—indicating how much the group had shared—and rated how well they’d exchanged information. Experimenters tallied the number of shared items, noted the objective quality of the decision, and analyzed these data in relation to the leader’s narcissism.<br> As expected, the group members rated the most narcissistic leaders as most effective. But they were wrong. In fact, the groups led by the greatest egotists chose the worse candidate for the job. Says [lead researcher<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><strong>Barbara</strong>]<strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Nevicka</strong>, “The narcissistic leaders had a very negative effect on their performance.

<p></p>  The brain on the right has so much CSF (brain fluid) that there&#8217;s almost no brain tissue left (in at least one cross section) - the center is hollow; at it&#8217;s thickest, it&#8217;s 2 inches thick. It belongs to a 126 IQ, socially normal university student (circa 1980 - I&#8217;d like to see how he&#8217;s doing now).<p></p>  So, we can be pleased to find such resiliency, but my emotional glass is more empty: I may be accumulating all sorts of brain damage (environmental toxins, alcohol, fever, high-altitude hiking, heading soccer balls, colliding in beach volleyball, cancer, prions, alzheimers lesions) yet feel and act apparently fine, as long as the damage happens gradually enough.

<p></p> X axis: wealth (socio-economic status). Y axis: child IQ. <p></p> White adoptive and biological-child families, mix of asian and white adopted babies (4 mo. old) - I assume from outside the U.S. I also assume that the poorest families are actually not terribly poor (they&#8217;re rich enough to be qualified for this adoption agency).<p></p> It&#8217;s tempting to say, under the assumption that people treat their adopted children the same as biological children, &#8220;IQ is mainly genetic, and good (bad) genes cause (after a few generations) high (low) wealth&#8221;, but I&#8217;m sure the prenatal (and first 4 months&#8217;) environment is an important cause as well, and you can imagine selection effects involving mothers who neither abort nor keep their child. The low-wealth families adopting children end up with smarter offspring than their non-adopting low-wealth counterparts and inversely for high-wealth (for the middle of the pack, there&#8217;s not much difference).<p></p> I believe that nearly all the families (even the poorest) were sufficiently rich and nurturing after childbirth that the differences are due mostly to the quality of the baby. It could be that the poorest (wealthiest) non-adopting parents somehow provide an exceptionally poor (good) prenatal and first-4-months environment, but that&#8217;s odd considering the quality of post-4-months-care is identically sufficient. You would have to believe that prenatal sufficiency is a much higher bar - which is credible; fetal development is probably a delicate thing. If it&#8217;s not in the prenatal or first-4-months environment, it&#8217;s in the genes. That sucks (in terms of being able to hope for technological improvements allowing all to enjoy the priveleges of the rich, that aren&#8217;t eugenic), but appears to be true.
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the genetic or prenatal quality of the adopted children is better or worse, but their combination seems similar to U.S. middle-class.</p>
<p>You can also consider adopted child trying hard enough to get Bs or As in school (harder than a biological child), or sibling competition effects.</p>

		   People sometimes intentionally deaden their facial expressions when they&#8217;re lying. They think they&#8217;ve completely eliminated them, but they&#8217;ve just reduced them. The mouth area is more easily controlled than the brow area (compare to fake smiles lacking the crinkling around the outside of the eyes). Also, the suppression may be non-specific - the liars will smile less in friendly interaction.<p></p>  But the extra cognitive load in protecting a lie can be more detectible than physical signs.

			Carb Binges Against a Low-carb Background</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		   In low carb diets, the protein-&gt;glucose pathway is mostly utilized to fill the liver with glycogen (a long-lasting store of glucose, to feed the brain, and if any is left over, to refill muscle glycogen or store in fat). So it&#8217;s hard to do anything other than lose fat (although with enough dietary fat you may be able to gain).<p></p>  For athletes, eating carbs on workout day, or to near-bursting once or twice a week (following a muscle glycogen depleting workout, possibly), is thought to help maintain or build muscle while losing fat (just cutting calories while maintaining enough protein in diet, you&#8217;ll still lose plenty of muscle mass along with fat mass). I first heard of this from <a href="http://www.lylemcdonald.com/">Lyle McDonald</a> (look for &#8220;depletion workout&#8221; and &#8220;refeed&#8221;). I&#8217;m not sure how strong the evidence is, but there are several plausible mechanisms beyond the claim below that alternating carb-loading and carb-avoiding will increase glycogen storage capacity, which would make for a better low-carb diet experience (more energy available, especially compared to the Atkins-type 50g/day or less of carbs and the accompanying ketosis-only malaise - although I guess burned proteins contribute less to cancer than burned glucose or fat).<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="">Excess amino acids are oxidized for energy. This may be why many people feel a slight surge of energy after a high-protein meal. (A related effect is associated with alcohol consumption, which is often masked by the relaxing effect also associated with alcohol consumption.) Amino acid oxidation is not associated with cancer. Neither is fat oxidation. But glucose oxidation is; this is known as the Warburg effect.<br> <p></p> A high-protein LC approach will not work very well for athletes who deplete major amounts of muscle glycogen as part of their daily training regimens. These folks will invariably need more carbohydrates to keep their performance levels up. Ultimately this is a numbers game. The protein-to-glucose conversion rate is about 2-to-1. If an athlete depletes 300 g of muscle glycogen per day, he or she will need about 600 g of protein to replenish that based only on protein. This is too high an intake of protein by any standard.<p></p>  A recreational exerciser who depletes 60 g of glycogen 3 times per week can easily replenish that muscle glycogen with dietary protein. Someone who exercises with weights for 40 minutes 3 times per week will deplete about that much glycogen each time. Contrary to popular belief, muscle glycogen is only minimally replenished postprandially (i.e., after meals) based on dietary sources. Liver glycogen replenishment is prioritized postprandially. Muscle glycogen is replenished over several days, primarily based on liver glycogen. It is one fast-filling tank replenishing another slow-filling one.<p></p>  Recreational exercisers who are normoglycemic and who do LC intermittently tend to increase the size of their liver glycogen tank over time, via<a href="http://healthcorrelator.blogspot.com/2010/06/compensatory-adaptation-as-unifying.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">compensatory adaptation</a>, and also use more fat (and ketones, which are byproducts of fat metabolism) as sources of energy. Somewhat paradoxically, these folks benefit from regular high carbohydrate intake days (e.g., once a week, or on exercise days), since their liver glycogen tanks will typically store more glycogen. If they keep their liver and muscle glycogen tanks half empty all the time, compensatory adaptation suggests that both their liver and muscle glycogen tanks will over time become smaller, and that their muscles will store more fat.</div></blockquote>

Our polls showed audiences already knew about them or didn&#8217;t believe they were true.</p> </blockquote> <p>The solution, apparently, was a re-jiggering of language. Morris relates that communications strategist Bob Squier had the following bright idea:</p> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"> <p>The key…was to cite the achievement while talking about something he was going to do. For example: &#8220;The hundred thousand extra police we put on the street can&#8217;t solve the crime problem by themselves; we need to keep anti-drug funding in the budget and stop Republicans from cutting it.&#8221; Or: &#8220;The seven million jobs we&#8217;ve created won&#8217;t be much use if we can&#8217;t find education people to fill them.

<p></p> <p>Linguists of course will recognize that this language is infested with presuppositions—those fascinating linguistic organisms, which because of their<em>presumption</em></p>
<p></p>of truth, head deniability off at the pass. There are no fewer than six distinct, politically-relevant presuppositions in the above brief excerpt. <p>Once you know about the linguistic properties of presuppositions, it seems intuitively natural that they should act as performance-enhancing aids for claims, particularly when it comes to believability. After all, their entire reason for living is to allow the speaker to signal that certain information is already taken for granted as shared knowledge—and if it&#8217;s not, then the hearer should accommodate it post-haste into his set of background assumptions.</p> <p>In fact, psychological studies as far back as the seventies have shown that people can be so eager to accommodate presupposed information that they might even tweak their own memories accordingly. In a study led by memory scientist Elizabeth Loftus, people who&#8217;d witnessed simulated car crashes were more likely to mistakenly remember a stop sign when asked &#8221;<em>Do you remember seeing the stop sign?&#8221;</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Half of you doesn&#8217;t run away while the other half fights. Something mediates.<p></p>  It&#8217;s thought that the left hemisphere constantly produces explanations (confabulations) for what we&#8217;re feeling, doing, and seeing. In severely damaged brains (e.g. communication between hemispheres severed completely - always interesting), the explanations (of what the non-connected half of the body is seeing/doing) seem like lies, but really the explaining part has no awareness of the truth, and apparently no shame - always producing the best explanation it can, without admitting failure.

The programme is carried out, profits are made and the environment is harmed. </blockquote> <blockquote> <p style="margin: 0.4em 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Did the CEO intentionally harm the environment?

Instead, the moral character of an action’s consequences also seems to influence how non-moral aspects of the action – in this case, whether someone did something intentionally or not – are judged.<sup class="reference" style="line-height: 1em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Knobe#cite_note-7" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(6, 69, 173); background-image: none;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p> </blockquote>  This bit of apparent stupidity is probably more than just an aversion to (publicly) assign credit to people (because it will incline us toward rewarding the person we credit), or a prejudice against CEOs.<p></p>  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6jb/how_to_annoy_misanthropes_and_bleedinghearts/">HT</a>

Similar receptors exist in humans, and sweaty t-shirts are preferred with increasingly dissimilar MHC.<p></p>  Women prefer the sweaty t-shirts of more physically masculine men when fertile; otherwise they don&#8217;t care as much or can&#8217;t detect it as well.<p></p>  Women tolerate feminine-looking men (e.g. soft, youthful face) relatively more when they&#8217;re less fertile.<p></p>  Women&#8217;s menstrual cycles may change after smelling another woman&#8217;s sweat.<p></p>  Activating vasopressin receptors in the brain causes pair-bonding;polygamous species can be made monogamous and vice versa by manipulating the receptors for vasopressin, or its prevalence.

Watson showed him a fuzzy white rat. Albert seemed to like the rat well enough. After Albert liking the rat had been confirmed, Watson showed him the rat again, but this time also played a very loud and scary noise; he repeated this intervention until, as expected, Albert was terrified of the white rat.<p></p>  But it wasn&#8217;t just fuzzy white rats Albert didn&#8217;t like. Further investigation determined that Albert was also afraid of brown rabbits (fuzzy animal) and Santa Claus (fuzzy white beard).</span></blockquote>

The pigeons ended up developing what he called &#8220;superstitions&#8221;; if a reward arrived by coincidence when a pigeon was tilting its head in a certain direction, the pigeon would continue tilting its head in that direction in the hope of gaining more rewards; when the reward randomly arrived, the pigeon took this as &#8220;justification&#8221; of its head-tilting and head-tilted even more.</span></blockquote>
<p>People also don&#8217;t look for negative confirmation when they&#8217;re told to learn a pattern. They usually do this poorly even when forming explicit plans (not only with automatic learning), e.g.</p>

<p>The &#8220;positive test strategy&#8221; is sometimes a useful heuristic, but it&#8217;s embarrassing how bad people are at escaping it (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Wason.27s_research_on_hypothesis-testing">Wason&#8217;s &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221; experiment</a> and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Klayman_and_Ha.27s_critique">Bayesian refinement</a>).</p>

</span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">[There is a strong] correlation between<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">educational</em><span> </span>TV shows and so-called &#8220;relational aggression&#8221; - things like bullying, name-calling, and deliberate ostracism. The shows most strongly correlated with bad behavior were heart-warming educational programs intended to teach morality. Why?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The researchers theorize that the structure of these shows often involved a child committing an immoral action, the child looking cool and strong, and then at the end of the show the child eventually gets a comeuppance (think Harry Potter, where evil character Draco Malfoy is the coolest and most popular kid in Hogwarts and usually gets away with it, whereas supposedly sympathetic character Ron Weasley is at best a lovable loser who spends most of his time as the butt of Draco&#8217;s jokes). The theory is that children are just not good enough at the whole feedback of conseqeunces thing to realize that the bully&#8217;s comeuppance in the end is supposed to be the inevitable result of their evil ways. All they see is someone being a bully and then being treated as obviously popular and high-status.</p>
