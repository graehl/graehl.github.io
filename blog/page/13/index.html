<div style=""> <blockquote> <p>Clinton&#8217;s achievements were a problem. In strategy meetings, he often complained that he had created seven million jobs and cut the deficit but no one seemed to notice. In speeches, he referred to the achievements awkwardly. Our polls showed audiences already knew about them or didn&#8217;t believe they were true.</p> </blockquote> <p>The solution, apparently, was a re-jiggering of language. Morris relates that communications strategist Bob Squier had the following bright idea:</p> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"> <p>The key…was to cite the achievement while talking about something he was going to do. For example: &#8220;The hundred thousand extra police we put on the street can&#8217;t solve the crime problem by themselves; we need to keep anti-drug funding in the budget and stop Republicans from cutting it.&#8221; Or: &#8220;The seven million jobs we&#8217;ve created won&#8217;t be much use if we can&#8217;t find education people to fill them. That&#8217;s why I want a tax deduction for college tuition to help kids go on to college to take those jobs.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p></p>
<p></p> <p>Linguists of course will recognize that this language is infested with presuppositions—those fascinating linguistic organisms, which because of their<em>presumption</em></p>
<p></p>of truth, head deniability off at the pass. There are no fewer than six distinct, politically-relevant presuppositions in the above brief excerpt. <p>Once you know about the linguistic properties of presuppositions, it seems intuitively natural that they should act as performance-enhancing aids for claims, particularly when it comes to believability. After all, their entire reason for living is to allow the speaker to signal that certain information is already taken for granted as shared knowledge—and if it&#8217;s not, then the hearer should accommodate it post-haste into his set of background assumptions.</p> <p>In fact, psychological studies as far back as the seventies have shown that people can be so eager to accommodate presupposed information that they might even tweak their own memories accordingly. In a study led by memory scientist Elizabeth Loftus, people who&#8217;d witnessed simulated car crashes were more likely to mistakenly remember a stop sign when asked &#8221;<em>Do you remember seeing the stop sign?&#8221;</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Imprudent action feels like an unwillingness to help future-me at now-me&#8217;s expense.<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite">The researchers asked a group of college seniors — three weeks before graduation — to read a passage that described college graduation either as an event that would prompt a major change in their identities or as an event that would prompt only a relatively trivial change. Compared to students who read the passage describing graduation as a small change, those who read a description of the event as a major change were much more likely to make more impatient choices, choosing to receive a gift certificate worth $120 in the next week rather than wait a year for up to $240.<p></p>  Their work suggests that people can be motivated to hold onto their money, or make more prudent decisions by increasing their sense of connectedness to their future selves, the researchers said.</blockquote> <br> <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/connection-to-your-future-self-impacts-your-financial-decision-making">HT</a>

<p>4-6% relative? so the gap went from e.g. 20% to 19%? or absolute? (from 20% to 15%)?</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #5b5b5b; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Nimbus Sans L,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">&#8220;But with high expectations, there is a change in teacher practices and more willingness and interest on their part. Teachers are saying they want more.&#8221;</span></blockquote>
<p>all we need are high expectations.</p>
<p></p>  i wish them all sustained exuberance and effort.

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      Eagleman in <a href="http://graehl.org/tagIncognito">Incognito</a>, with Mrs. G., recovering from a severe stroke:<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite">When I asked her to close her eyes, she said &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and closed one eye, as in a permanent wink.<br> &#8220;Are your eyes closed?&#8221; I asked.<br> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.<br> &#8220;Both eyes?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> I held up three fingers. &#8220;how many fingers am I holding up, Mrs. G.?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Three,&#8221; she said.<br> &#8220;And your eyes are closed?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> &#8220;Then how did you know how many fingers I was holding up?&#8221;<br> An interesting silence followed </blockquote> <blockquote type="cite">&#8230;<br> I wheeled Mrs. G in front [of a mirror] and asked if she could see her own face. She said yes. I then asked her to close both her eyes. Again she closed one eye and not the other.<br> &#8220;Are <i>both</i> your eyes closed?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> &#8220;Can you see yourself?&#8221;<br> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br> &#8220;Does it seem possible to see yourself in the mirror if both your eyes are closed?&#8221;<br> Pause. <i>No conclusion</i>.<br> &#8220;Does it look to you like one eye is closed or that both are closed?&#8221;<br> Pause. <i>No conclusion</i>.<br> </blockquote> Well, duh. How can she answer that question when both her eyes are closed? :)<p></p>  &#8230;<p></p>  Even though it&#8217;s profitable to model our brains as collections of autonomous semi-intelligent programs, there&#8217;s still coordination. In healthy people, only one motor program runs at once. Half of your body doesn&#8217;t try to eat the cake while the other half tries to restrain it. Half of you doesn&#8217;t run away while the other half fights. Something mediates.<p></p>  It&#8217;s thought that the left hemisphere constantly produces explanations (confabulations) for what we&#8217;re feeling, doing, and seeing. In severely damaged brains (e.g. communication between hemispheres severed completely - always interesting), the explanations (of what the non-connected half of the body is seeing/doing) seem like lies, but really the explaining part has no awareness of the truth, and apparently no shame - always producing the best explanation it can, without admitting failure.

Watson showed him a fuzzy white rat. Albert seemed to like the rat well enough. After Albert liking the rat had been confirmed, Watson showed him the rat again, but this time also played a very loud and scary noise; he repeated this intervention until, as expected, Albert was terrified of the white rat.<p></p>  But it wasn&#8217;t just fuzzy white rats Albert didn&#8217;t like. Further investigation determined that Albert was also afraid of brown rabbits (fuzzy animal) and Santa Claus (fuzzy white beard).</span></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the kid turned out fine.</p>

The pigeons ended up developing what he called &#8220;superstitions&#8221;; if a reward arrived by coincidence when a pigeon was tilting its head in a certain direction, the pigeon would continue tilting its head in that direction in the hope of gaining more rewards; when the reward randomly arrived, the pigeon took this as &#8220;justification&#8221; of its head-tilting and head-tilted even more.</span></blockquote>
<p>People also don&#8217;t look for negative confirmation when they&#8217;re told to learn a pattern. They usually do this poorly even when forming explicit plans (not only with automatic learning), e.g.</p>

<p>The &#8220;positive test strategy&#8221; is sometimes a useful heuristic, but it&#8217;s embarrassing how bad people are at escaping it (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Wason.27s_research_on_hypothesis-testing">Wason&#8217;s &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221; experiment</a> and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Klayman_and_Ha.27s_critique">Bayesian refinement</a>).</p>

</span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">[There is a strong] correlation between<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">educational</em><span> </span>TV shows and so-called &#8220;relational aggression&#8221; - things like bullying, name-calling, and deliberate ostracism. The shows most strongly correlated with bad behavior were heart-warming educational programs intended to teach morality. Why?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The researchers theorize that the structure of these shows often involved a child committing an immoral action, the child looking cool and strong, and then at the end of the show the child eventually gets a comeuppance (think Harry Potter, where evil character Draco Malfoy is the coolest and most popular kid in Hogwarts and usually gets away with it, whereas supposedly sympathetic character Ron Weasley is at best a lovable loser who spends most of his time as the butt of Draco&#8217;s jokes). The theory is that children are just not good enough at the whole feedback of conseqeunces thing to realize that the bully&#8217;s comeuppance in the end is supposed to be the inevitable result of their evil ways. All they see is someone being a bully and then being treated as obviously popular and high-status.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Incognito-Secret-Lives-David-Eagleman/dp/0307377334/">David Eagleman&#8217;s book</a></p>
<p></p>  Sound and vision are integrated at a low level. Double-beep with single-flash is perceived as double-flash.<p></p>  What gets sent to higher-level processing are differences between expected input and actual input (number of connections sending info from higher-level part to lower-level vision is greater than low-&gt;high). Also e.g. you can&#8217;t tickle yourself. [perhaps this anticipation helps learning precisely timed hand-eye (more generally: motor-sensory) moves as in sports, music, and dance]. Further, decisions, movements, and inputs are shifted (after learning) so that causally-connected inputs+decisions are perceived as happening at the same time (they&#8217;re not; different senses have different lags). e.g. if a button-&gt;flash mechanism has a 1/10 sec delay, you&#8217;ll adjust and feel that the light comes on at the same time as you push the button; remove the delay, and then on your next push you think the light came before the push.<p></p>  More visually-salient events (a larger/brighter/moving square) are perceived as longer duration.<p></p>  Implicit learning: e.g. unconscious (visual) learning: experts at sexing day old chickens, or spotting German vs. British planes in WWII, are clueless to describe the features they use. But after weeks of teaching by example (student gets the same view, guesses yes/no, is corrected by expert) most people can learn.<p></p>  People who can&#8217;t recall any new memories learn the skill of Tetris exactly as well as normal people; their dreams are also filled with falling blocks, although they won&#8217;t remember that they came from a game they were playing.<p></p>  Liking those who are like you: if Rasputin shares your birthday, you describe him in more favorable terms. If something or someone has a similar name, you like them more. Weird. Presumably there&#8217;s some innate same-physical-type (obviously including race, maybe sex) respect or liking as well. First-letter match of name matters for profession, mate, etc. and first-sound or first-few-letters is even stronger.<p></p>  Priming/exposure: even though you don&#8217;t remember seeing something recently, you&#8217;re more likely to recall it (e.g. look at your word choices). If you&#8217;ve seen a face before, you&#8217;ll find it more attractive than if it&#8217;s new (stranger danger?) If you&#8217;ve heard a claim before (even if you judged it dubious or false the first time), you&#8217;re more likely to think it&#8217;s true the second time (possibly part of you remembers that it&#8217;s familiar and that&#8217;s weak evidence for its validity; this seems reasonable to me, and of course that vote can be overwhelmed if you remember specific strong reasons against it).<p></p>  Association: standard advertising tricks.<p></p>  Hunches: shuffled decks of cards with win/lose (money) outcomes; you know some are more favorable than others. You&#8217;ll take 25 draws before you&#8217;ll say which decks are good, but you have sweaty hands drawing from a bad deck by the 13th draw.<p></p>  Soliciting hunch-feelings: if you&#8217;re not self-aware, flip a coin to decide. If, seeing the result, you think letting the coin decide is stupid, your hunch was for the opposite. If you go along with the coin, then you had no strong hunch to the contrary. That&#8217;s why telling someone &#8220;flip a coin to decide&#8221; after they&#8217;ve reached an impasse is useful advice (if they don&#8217;t follow it perfectly).<p></p>  Brains of experts are faster and more energy efficient (in their expert skill, of course) than people who are worse. We can speculate that they were spending more energy while learning (and consciously coaching themselves, or listening to coaching). People who learned Tetris well exhibited this pattern (eventually: electrically quiet brain; skill burned into [low-level?] efficient brain circuits). This is why experts can sometimes choke under pressure; they start interfering by trying to consciously control what&#8217;s become implicit.

</span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">One of the things that has always baffled me about psychedelics such as LSD, LSA or psilocybin (the active ingredient of &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221;) is that their actions seem far too specific to be caused by a simple substance.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The effect I am referring to is that for some people and in some contexts, they cause what is often called a spiritual experience, i.e., experience that is deeply meaningful to the user and possibly long-term world-view (and behaviour) altering.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Look for example at<span> </span><a href="http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6693" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">this study</a></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">From my limited experience, and from what I observed in friends, I would say that psychedelics can be used to increase rationality, specifically by eliminating those sources of irrationality stemming from self-deception. They seem to allow the reexamination of deeply ingrained beliefs about the self and the world, that are beyond everyday reach.</p>

Perhaps the harm is very small, or nonexistent. But for sure, large amounts are harmful and cause obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.  It&#8217;s definitely above average to consume over 400g of sugar and thus over 200g of fructose, daily, but probably 1/3 of American teens+adults do (complete guess).

			Chewing Gum Increases Alertness</a>
	</h2>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">
</span><blockquote>
<p><strong>Effects of chewing gum on cognitive function, mood and physiology in stressed and non-stressed volunteers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RATIONALE</strong>:</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that chewing gum may improve aspects of cognitive function and mood. There is also evidence suggesting that chewing gum reduces stress. It is important, therefore, to examine these two areas and to determine whether contextual factors (chewing habit, type of gum, and personality) modify such effects.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>:</p>
<p>The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine whether chewing gum improved mood and mental performance; (ii) to determine whether chewing gum had benefits in stressed individuals; and (iii) to determine whether chewing habit, type of gum and level of anxiety modified the effects of gum.</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:</strong></p>
<p>A cross-over study involving 133 volunteers was carried out. Each volunteer carried out a test session when they were chewing gum and without gum, with order of gum conditions counterbalanced across subjects. Baseline sessions were conducted prior to each test session. Approximately half of the volunteers were tested in 75 dBA noise (the stress condition) and the rest in quiet. Volunteers were stratified on chewing habit and anxiety level. Approximately, half of the volunteers were given mint gum and half fruit gum. The volunteers rated their mood at the start and end of each session and had their heart rate monitored over the session. Saliva samples were taken to allow cortisol levels (good indicator of alertness and stress) to be assayed. During the session, volunteers carried out tasks measuring a range of cognitive functions (aspects of memory, selective and sustained attention, psychomotor speed and accuracy).</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong>:</p>
<p>Chewing gum was associated with greater alertness and a more positive mood. Reaction times were quicker in the gum condition, and this effect became bigger as the task became more difficult. Chewing gum also improved selective and sustained attention. Heart rate and cortisol levels were higher when chewing which confirms the alerting effect of chewing gum.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>:</p>
<p>Overall, the r<strong>esults suggest that chewing gum produces a number of benefits that are generally observed and not context-dependent.</strong><span> </span>In contrast to some previous research, chewing gum failed to improve memory. Further research is now required to increase our knowledge of the behavioral effects of chewing gum and to identify the underlying mechanisms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe cortisol goes up with any physical activity.</p>
<p>Chewing gum might be bad for you in other ways (e.g. possible jaw RSI).</p>
<p>The improved focus and mood works under the quiet or the distressingly-loud-noise condition.</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~graehl/papers/null.multivitamin.pdf">study</a></p>
<p>The 1.07 hazard ratio (7% higher chance of dropping dead at any moment) for men is indeed not significant; a simpler model that doesn&#8217;t control for as many things (including use of some single supplement e.g. selenium) gives a HR=.99, for example.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s unlikely that vitamins do nothing. Yet they appear to, in this fairly large study of old people. I&#8217;d say this is reason to look at fine-tuning vitamin/mineral intake. Those men who took 1-6/week instead of 1x or 2x/day seemed to fare slightly better than 0/week (TOTALLY not significant though).<p></p>  Too much of some things in diet+multivitamin is likely quite harmful to health. If you ignore statistical significance, the weak evidence is that those old people who take multivitamins for a 5 year stretch are slightly more likely to end up dead 10-15 years later.<p></p>  Or, supposing that multivitamins aren&#8217;t harmful (they obviously vary tremendously in composition), it&#8217;s really true that it&#8217;s unlikely that your normal diet is lacking anything you need, and the non-significant effect is mostly due to confounds like taking vitamins because you feel your health start to fail, or taking vitamins because you live a healthy lifestyle already, etc.<p></p>  Unfortunately, that multivitamins do nothing, or are both helpful and harmful, with the harms slightly outweighing the benefits, is the simplest explanation of many such null results in the literature. But I don&#8217;t want to accept it, because I know of some specific causal evidence suggesting that individual vitamins, when supplemented, yield health benefits in a majority of people. So I&#8217;ll hold the slightly more complicated: &#8220;most multivitamins are too-highly dosing at least a few things, in a way that harms health as much as the rest of it benefits health&#8221;, tentatively.<p></p>  Another nearly siginificant pattern: people who&#8217;ve used vitamins for at least 5 years die less than those who recently started or never used (but again, not really significant). Motivated speculation (not wanting to believe multi-vitamins are actually net-harmful or -useless): old people who suddenly start taking multivitamins did so due to correctly feeling their declining health and imminent death. So their higher rate of death shouldn&#8217;t be blamed on having recently started multivitamins.

<p>uh-oh. i like my high-protein diet. i need muscles to do well in soccer and volleyball. and it&#8217;s easy not to overeat when you&#8217;re not craving protein. this suggests a benefit from titrating protein somehow (being sensitive to how much of it you need for your activity level).</p>

As a result, protein appetite drives overconsumption of energy on low percent protein diets, promoting obesity and metabolic disorders with consequent effects on longevity</span></blockquote>
<p>so, be skinny, on as little protein as you can get away with (obviously you&#8217;ll die with 0 protein in your diet; likewise with 0 fat).</p>

This may not result from benefits associated with CR per se, but rather reflect the costs of nutrient imbalance when feeding ad libitum on a fixed diet. As the required balance of nutrients changes over time (with time of day, season, growth and development, and senescence), animals will be forced to overeat some nutrients to gain enough of others</span></blockquote>
<p>speculation without evidence - they seem to be suggesting that ideally you eat the minimum amount of food necessary for all vitamin / macronutrient needs. but it&#8217;s also true that if you have excess body fat, you&#8217;ll survive surgery better. some excess makes you more robust. we can&#8217;t really titrate perfectly.</p>
<p></p>  i suppose the overall question would be: how much quality of life do you have to sacrifice by risking insufficient intake of various nutrients, in order to maybe live longer? nobody knows the answer for humans, yet.<p></p>
