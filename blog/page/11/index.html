			Marijuana Brain Damage Less Than Thought - and Reversible</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>(updated with the actual study abstract, which is more informative than the Wired article)</div>
<p></p>
<div>The immediate (within a few days) detrimental effects of marijuana on working memory are pretty strong. I find working memory pretty important for the thinking and especially the computer programming I do.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But it&#8217;s not all bad - mood improves, and so does performance on some (useless-seeming to me) remote association of words and whatever &#8220;divergent thinking&#8221; is. Also, there&#8217;s weak evidence that the harmful effects will disappear completely after a few weeks of abstinence.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Heavy drinking is definitely worse for you than marijuana (aside from some increased risk of mouth/throat/lung cancer if you&#8217;re smoking it).</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is not a randomized intervention study; it&#8217;s just cognitive measurements vs. a few hundred survey responses on marijuana use. The fact that you&#8217;re thus seeing correlations and not necessarily causes is unfortunate. But it is over 8 years, which is nice:</div>
<p></p>
<div>From the abstract of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03574.x/abstract">the actual study in Addiction</a>:</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) (immediate and delayed), Spot-the-Word test (STW), Symbol Digit Modality test (SDMT) and Digit Backwards (DB). Groups of cannabis users were defined from self-reports across three waves as: ‘never’ (</span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">n</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 420) ‘remain light’ (</span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">n</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 71), ‘former light’ (</span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">n</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 231), ‘remain heavy’ (</span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">n</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 60), ‘former heavy’ (</span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">n</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 60) and ‘always former’ (since start of study) (</span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">n</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 657).</span>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>So they measured 2000 people 3 times over 8 years, while asking them how much marijuana they were use. They started with 2400. Too bad we&#8217;ll never know if the dropouts were especially heavy pot users :) They performed an analysis that&#8217;s intended to show whether voluntary non-blind (obviously) changes in marijuana usage helped or hurt cognitive performance in the same individual - which would be more telling than observing some leftover unexplained correlation between pot and stupidity (after controlling for age/education/socioeconomic/etc.) at a single point in time.</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"> baseline there were significant differences between cannabis groups on CVLT (immediate and delayed) and SDMT. However, after controlling for education, gender, gender × group and gender × wave, there were no significant between-group differences and only CVLT immediate recall reached adjusted statistically significant longitudinal change associated with changed cannabis use (group × wave </span><em style="font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">P</em><span style="font-family: Arial, Lucida Grande, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">= 0.007). Specifically, former heavy users improved their performance relative to remaining heavy users (estimated marginal means: former heavy 6.1–7.5: remain heavy 6.4–6.6</span>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Definitely switching from &#8220;heavy use&#8221; to &#8220;former heavy use&#8221; (maybe not even completely abstaining) gives about an 8% improvement in the ability to remember things recently read (short term verbal memory) (that there is no improvement at all is less than 0.7% probable).</div>
<p></p>
<div>It&#8217;s also possible that by &#8220;controlling for education&#8221; (missing: socioeconomic class, but this is Australia) they&#8217;re hiding an effect of marijuana that makes you simultaneously stupid and less likely to finish school. This would be my major complaint with the study (unless they consider only level of education at the study start, and show expected changes per individual over time in response to changed marijuana usage).</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">That [marijuana makes you stupid], at least, has been the collective stereotype for decades. There’s even been some <a href="http://alcoholism.about.com/od/pot/a/blaan060315.htm" style="color: #238db1; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">science</a> to back it up, especially when the marijuana use begins at an <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2010-11-16/news/29302257_1_early-onset-marijuana-users-smokers" style="color: #238db1; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">early age</a>. But now a different answer is beginning to emerge, thanks to an authoritative new study led by Robert Tait at the Australian National University. The scientists looked at the long-term cognitive effects of marijuana use in nearly 2,000 subjects between the ages of 20 and 24. The subjects were divided (based on self-reports) into several different categories, from total abstainers (n = 420) to “current light users” (n = 71) to “former heavy users” (n = 60). Over the course of eight years, the scientists gave the subjects a battery of standard cognitive tests, most of which focused on working memory, verbal memory and intelligence. One of the important advantages of this study is that the scientists controlled for a number of relevant variables, such as education and gender. In <em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Time</em>, <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/07/19/study-marijuana-not-linked-with-long-term-cognitive-impairment/" style="color: #238db1; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Maia Szalavitz</a> explains why this statistical adjustment is necessary:</p>
<blockquote style="padding-top: 2px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 40px; font-style: italic; background-image: ; background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; margin: 0px;">
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The lower education levels of the pot smokers — and their greater likelihood of being male — had made it look like marijuana had significantly affected their intelligence. In fact, men simply tend to do worse than women on tests of verbal intelligence, while women generally underperform on math tests. The relative weighting of the tests made the impact of pot look worse than it was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">Once these population differences were corrected for, the long-term effects of marijuana use disappeared: The scientists found that “there were no significant between group differences.” In other words, the amount of pot consumed had no measurable impact on cognitive performance. The sole exception was performance on a test of short-term verbal memory, in which “current heavy users” performed slightly worse than former users. The researchers conclude that, contrary to earlier findings, the mind altering properties of marijuana are ephemeral and fleeting:</p>
<blockquote style="padding-top: 2px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 40px; font-style: italic; background-image: ; background-color: #ffffff; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; margin: 0px;">
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The adverse impacts of cannabis use on cognitive functions either appear to be related to pre-existing factors or are reversible in this community cohort even after potentially extended periods of use. These findings may be useful in motivating individuals to lower cannabis use, even after an extensive history of heavy intake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">This study builds on previous work by <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/10.11/marijuana.html" style="color: #238db1; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Harvard researchers</a> demonstrating that the learning and memory impairments of heavy marijuana users typically vanish within 28 days of “smoking cessation.” (The slight impairments still existed, however, one week after smoking.) While several days might sound like a long hippocampal hangover, heavy alcohol users typically experience deficits that persist for several months, if not years. In other words, heavy marijuana use appears to be a lot less damaging than alcoholism.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">Taken together, these studies demonstrate that popular stereotypes of marijuana users are unfair and untrue. While it’s definitely not a good idea to perform a cognitively demanding task (such as driving!) while stoned, smoking a joint probably also won’t lead to any measurable long-term deficits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski" style="color: #238db1; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The Dude</a>, in other words, wasn’t dumb because he inhaled. He was dumb because he was The Dude. (All those White Russians probably didn’t help, either.)</p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">Furthermore, there’s some intriguing evidence that marijuana can actually <em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">improve</em> performance on some mental tests. A recent <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20122742" style="color: #238db1; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">paper</a> by scientists at University College, London looked at a phenomenon called semantic priming. This occurs when the activation of one word allows us to react more quickly to related words. For instance, the word “dog” might lead to decreased reaction times for “cat,” “pet” and “Lassie,” but won’t alter how quickly we react to “chair.”</p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">Interestingly, the scientists found that marijuana seems to induce a state of <em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">hyper-priming</em>, in which the reach of semantic priming extends to distantly related concepts. As a result, we hear “dog” and think of nouns that, in more sober circumstances, would seem rather disconnected, such as “leash” or “hair.” This state of hyper-priming helps explain why cannabis has been so often used as a creative fuel, as it seems to make the brain better at detecting those remote associations that lead to radically new ideas.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Arial,Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px;">Why does marijuana increase access to far reaching intellectual connections? One possibility is that the beneficial effect of the drug is mediated by mood. Marijuana, after all, has long been used to quiet anxious nerves — big pharma is currently exploring targeted versions of THC as a next generation anxiolytic — as only a few puffs seem to dramatically increase feelings of relaxation and euphoria. (The technical term for this, of course, is getting stoned.) Furthermore, recent research has suggested that performance on various tests of remote associations and divergent thinking — a hallmark of creativity — are dramatically enhanced by such positive moods.</p>

<div style="">I wonder if people are under-creative when following orders by default, and can really benefit from this sort of badgering. I don&#8217;t believe the cliche &#8220;soft bigotry of low expectations&#8221; is generally the right explanation for underachievement, but maybe when it comes to satisfying the boss&#8217;s aesthetic, artistic courage typically earns insulting little rejections-by-tweak.</div>

		<div><strong>TV:</strong></div>
<p>The Big Bang Theory - watched it all in the past 3 weeks. Sheldon grew on me.</p>
<p>The Office - still good.</p>
<p>The Boss - excellent acting. Sexy and interesting in the way The Wire was for its first 1.5 seasons.</p>
<div><strong>Music:</strong></div>
<div>
<br>Sufjan Stevens - &#8220;John Wayne Gacy, Jr.&#8221; &#8221;The Seer&#8217;s Tower&#8221; &#8220;To Be Alone with You&#8221;, &#8220;For the Widows in Paradise, for the Fatherless in Ypsilanti&#8221;, &#8220;Sister Winter&#8221; - all excellent</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Books: </strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Stories of Your Life And Others (Ted Chiang) - fantastic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>REAMDE (Neal Stephenson) - diverting. Crichton-like. Too many bad-ass, cool characters. Hard to believe or care about most of it. Too long. Still worth reading.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Movies:</strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Beginners - similar artsy-emo lead as 500 days of summer, but more effectively brooding/poetic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Crazy Stupid Love - in spite of a cheesy closing act (not quite Mrs. Doubtfire - painful, but bad), really funny</div>
<div>
<br>Margin Call - entertaining. Good acting except for the always-boring Demi Moore. I didn&#8217;t care at all for the (Kevin Spacey) moral maybe-I&#8217;ll-be-a-hero hand-wringing. I loved the soundtrack+trading-calls montage at the climax.</div>
<div>
<br>The Secret In Their Eyes - fantastic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Midnight in Paris - good</div>
<p></p>
<div>Whatever Works - good</div>
<div>
<br>X-Men First Class - acceptable. better than the previous disaster.</div>
<div>
<br>Captain America (The First Avenger) - vapid but pretty. Felt like they ran out of money or ended up throwing out scenes - disjointed.</div>
<div>
<br>The Best of Youth (La meglio gioventù) - very good</div>
<p></p>
<div>Capturing the Friedmans - documentary. not recommended. ambiguous mix of overzealous/retarded community+law enforcement witch-hunt of actual creepy pedophile father. may interest people who aren&#8217;t already familiar with witch-hunts.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Lilya 4-ever - good. a bit slow.</div>

<div>More generally, we should consider whether &#8216;sending a message&#8217; is worth all the consequences. I wish policymakers  understood this.

Anyway, supposing you had a sincere-technocrat government (like Clinton&#8217;s was reputed to be), there&#8217;s no forum those technocrats could visit to hear sincere and competent analysis - anywhere power takes consultation becomes clogged with what amount to lobbyists, the best of them appearing to offer quality information and reasoning, indistinguishable from the virtuous impartial academics.</div>

			Lipoic Acid</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>(α-)lipoic acid (LA) is popular as a supplement. We don&#8217;t need any our diet to survive; we synthesize it. It&#8217;s a precursor for necessary mitochondrial enzymes (mitochondria, roughly speaking, burn oxygen to power our bodies). It&#8217;s plausible that beefing up the subtrate of material that&#8217;s used by the enzymes can compensate for their working less efficiently with age (this has been demonstrated in rats).</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; background-color: #ffffff;">Though LA has long been touted as an antioxidant, it has also been shown to improve glucose and ascorbate handling, increase eNOS activity, activate Phase II detoxification via the transcription factor Nrf2, and lower expression of MMP-9 and VCAM-1 through repression of NF-kappa B. LA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, may use their chemical properties as a redox couple to alter protein conformations by forming mixed disulfides. Beneficial effects are achieved with low micromolar levels of LA, suggesting that some of its therapeutic potential extends beyond the strict definition of an antioxidant. Current trials are investigating whether these beneficial properties of LA make it an appropriate treatment not just for diabetes, but also for the prevention of vascular disease, hypertension, and inflammation.</span></blockquote>
<p></p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19664690">via</a>. I don&#8217;t know what all that means; however, I&#8217;d suggest that since we synthesize it up to low concentrations, it&#8217;s almost certain to be useful at low concentrations :)</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>LA passes easily to the brain; however, it also quickly binds to protein. Unless you take enough (over 150 micromolar), it will ALL be bound to protein. So a single high dose might be needed to get any to the brain. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18655815">via</a>.</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>LA in vitro acts as a direct antioxidant (of ROS and RNS); also, protein-bound-LA in cells triggers natural anti-oxidant mechanisms (in a more sustained way than if free LA/DHLA were directly scavenging ROS/RNS) and reduces inflammation due to oxidative stress. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18409172">via</a>.</div>

For example, LA increases acetylcholine (ACh) production by activation of choline acetyltransferase and increases glucose uptake, thus supplying more acetyl-CoA for the production of ACh. LA chelates redox-active transition metals, thus inhibiting the formation of hydroxyl radicals and also scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby increasing the levels of reduced glutathione. In addition, LA down-regulates the expression of redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory proteins including TNF and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, LA can scavenge lipid peroxidation products such as hydroxynonenal and acrolein. </span></blockquote>

There are only two published studies, in which 600 mg LA was given daily to 43 patients with AD (receiving a standard treatment with choline-esterase inhibitors) in an open-label study over an observation period of up to 48 months. Whereas the improvement in patients with moderate dementia was not significant, the disease progressed extremely slowly (change in ADAScog: 1.2 points=year, MMSE: -0.6 points=year) in patients with mild dementia (ADAScog</span></blockquote>

<div>This is not double-blind, but the worsening of dementia was much slower than in other long-term studies (being treated with either nothing or choline-esterase inhibitors).</div>

In one study, subjects asked to generate their own hypotheses are more responsive to their accuracy than subjects asked to choose from among pre-picked hypotheses.<sup>16</sup> Another study required subjects to list reasons for and against each of the possible answers to each question on a quiz prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This process resulted in more accurate confidence judgments relative to a control group.<sup>17</sup> </li> <li>Training in microeconomics can help subjects avoid the sunk cost fallacy.<sup>18</sup> </li>
<li>Because people avoid the base rate fallacy more often when they encounter problems phrased in terms of frequencies instead of probabilities,<sup>19</sup> teaching people to translate probabilistic reasoning tasks into frequency formats improves their performance.<sup>20</sup> </li> <li>[&#8220;promote bias awareness&#8221;]</li>
<li>Research on the planning fallacy suggests that taking an &#8216;outside view&#8217; when predicting the time and resources required to complete a task will lead to better predictions. A specific instance of this strategy is &#8216;reference class forecasting&#8217;,<sup>25</sup> in which planners project time and resource costs for a project by basing their projections on the outcomes of a distribution of comparable projects.</li> <li>Unpacking the components involved in a large task or project helps people to see more clearly how much time and how many resources will be required to complete it, thereby partially meliorating the planning fallacy.<sup>26</sup> </li> <li>One reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that we do not remain as focused on the task at hand throughout its execution as when we are planning its execution. The planning fallacy can be partially meliorated, then, not only by improving the planning but by improving the execution. For example, in one study<sup>27</sup> students were taught to imagine themselves performing each of the steps needed to complete a project. Participants rehearsed these simulations each day. 41% of these students completed their tasks on time, compared to 14% in a control group.</li> </ol>
