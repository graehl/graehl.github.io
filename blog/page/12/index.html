<p style="background-color: #ffffff;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Jobs said. &#8220;You have to bring me something new. Nothing you&#8217;ve shown me is even close.&#8221;</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;">Vincent argued back and suddenly Jobs went ballistic. &#8220;He just started screaming at me,&#8221; Vincent recalled. Vincent could be volatile himself, and the volleys escalated.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;">When Vincent shouted, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to tell me what you want,&#8221; Jobs shot back, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to show me some stuff, and I&#8217;ll know it when I see it.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<div style="">I&#8217;d be furious too, hearing &#8220;nothing you&#8217;ve shown me is even close&#8221; from someone who has nothing constructive.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="">But, people who can&#8217;t make music can have definite musical tastes waiting to be fit with that perfectly arousing key. And they&#8217;d never get anything surprisingly good if they gave specific artistic direction to the composer.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="">I wonder if people are under-creative when following orders by default, and can really benefit from this sort of badgering. I don&#8217;t believe the cliche &#8220;soft bigotry of low expectations&#8221; is generally the right explanation for underachievement, but maybe when it comes to satisfying the boss&#8217;s aesthetic, artistic courage typically earns insulting little rejections-by-tweak.</div>

			Entertainment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div><strong>TV:</strong></div>
<p>The Big Bang Theory - watched it all in the past 3 weeks. Sheldon grew on me.</p>
<p>The Office - still good.</p>
<p>The Boss - excellent acting. Sexy and interesting in the way The Wire was for its first 1.5 seasons.</p>
<div><strong>Music:</strong></div>
<div>
<br>Sufjan Stevens - &#8220;John Wayne Gacy, Jr.&#8221; &#8221;The Seer&#8217;s Tower&#8221; &#8220;To Be Alone with You&#8221;, &#8220;For the Widows in Paradise, for the Fatherless in Ypsilanti&#8221;, &#8220;Sister Winter&#8221; - all excellent</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Books: </strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Stories of Your Life And Others (Ted Chiang) - fantastic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>REAMDE (Neal Stephenson) - diverting. Crichton-like. Too many bad-ass, cool characters. Hard to believe or care about most of it. Too long. Still worth reading.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Movies:</strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Beginners - similar artsy-emo lead as 500 days of summer, but more effectively brooding/poetic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Crazy Stupid Love - in spite of a cheesy closing act (not quite Mrs. Doubtfire - painful, but bad), really funny</div>
<div>
<br>Margin Call - entertaining. Good acting except for the always-boring Demi Moore. I didn&#8217;t care at all for the (Kevin Spacey) moral maybe-I&#8217;ll-be-a-hero hand-wringing. I loved the soundtrack+trading-calls montage at the climax.</div>
<div>
<br>The Secret In Their Eyes - fantastic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Midnight in Paris - good</div>
<p></p>
<div>Whatever Works - good</div>
<div>
<br>X-Men First Class - acceptable. better than the previous disaster.</div>
<div>
<br>Captain America (The First Avenger) - vapid but pretty. Felt like they ran out of money or ended up throwing out scenes - disjointed.</div>
<div>
<br>The Best of Youth (La meglio gioventù) - very good</div>
<p></p>
<div>Capturing the Friedmans - documentary. not recommended. ambiguous mix of overzealous/retarded community+law enforcement witch-hunt of actual creepy pedophile father. may interest people who aren&#8217;t already familiar with witch-hunts.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Lilya 4-ever - good. a bit slow.</div>

		<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/10/bad-sound-bad-sign.html">Robin Hanson observes</a> the damage to U.S. society caused by the ease of winning punitive-damages-by-jury. We&#8217;ve all experienced paranoid corporate hyper-protectiveness - being ordered off the field in a drizzle because you might slip on the grass and sue (sorry, our insurance contract requires this officiousness!)<p></p>
<div>More generally, we should consider whether &#8216;sending a message&#8217; is worth all the consequences. I wish policymakers  understood this. But &#8216;raising awareness&#8217; usually just makes us feel good. Anyway, supposing you had a sincere-technocrat government (like Clinton&#8217;s was reputed to be), there&#8217;s no forum those technocrats could visit to hear sincere and competent analysis - anywhere power takes consultation becomes clogged with what amount to lobbyists, the best of them appearing to offer quality information and reasoning, indistinguishable from the virtuous impartial academics.</div>

			Lipoic Acid</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>(α-)lipoic acid (LA) is popular as a supplement. We don&#8217;t need any our diet to survive; we synthesize it. It&#8217;s a precursor for necessary mitochondrial enzymes (mitochondria, roughly speaking, burn oxygen to power our bodies). It&#8217;s plausible that beefing up the subtrate of material that&#8217;s used by the enzymes can compensate for their working less efficiently with age (this has been demonstrated in rats).</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; background-color: #ffffff;">Though LA has long been touted as an antioxidant, it has also been shown to improve glucose and ascorbate handling, increase eNOS activity, activate Phase II detoxification via the transcription factor Nrf2, and lower expression of MMP-9 and VCAM-1 through repression of NF-kappa B. LA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, may use their chemical properties as a redox couple to alter protein conformations by forming mixed disulfides. Beneficial effects are achieved with low micromolar levels of LA, suggesting that some of its therapeutic potential extends beyond the strict definition of an antioxidant. Current trials are investigating whether these beneficial properties of LA make it an appropriate treatment not just for diabetes, but also for the prevention of vascular disease, hypertension, and inflammation.</span></blockquote>
<p></p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19664690">via</a>. I don&#8217;t know what all that means; however, I&#8217;d suggest that since we synthesize it up to low concentrations, it&#8217;s almost certain to be useful at low concentrations :)</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>LA passes easily to the brain; however, it also quickly binds to protein. Unless you take enough (over 150 micromolar), it will ALL be bound to protein. So a single high dose might be needed to get any to the brain. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18655815">via</a>.</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>LA in vitro acts as a direct antioxidant (of ROS and RNS); also, protein-bound-LA in cells triggers natural anti-oxidant mechanisms (in a more sustained way than if free LA/DHLA were directly scavenging ROS/RNS) and reduces inflammation due to oxidative stress. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18409172">via</a>.</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>LA enhances mitochondrial energy metabolism and protects against diabetic neuropathy (800mg/day). It also reduces migraine and headache frequency in migraine sufferers (600mg/day). <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17355494">via</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>LA chelates inorganic mercury (but reduces clearance of methylmercury, which is what you&#8217;re getting when you eat shark/swordfish/tuna/etc). <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1585376">via</a>. You&#8217;d take it after acute inorganic mercury exposure (in a dose depending on the exposure).</div>
<p></p>
<div>LA slows the progress of Alzheimer&#8217;s dementia (ibid):</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; background-color: #ffffff;">LA has been shown to have a variety of properties which can interfere with the pathogenesis or progression of AD. For example, LA increases acetylcholine (ACh) production by activation of choline acetyltransferase and increases glucose uptake, thus supplying more acetyl-CoA for the production of ACh. LA chelates redox-active transition metals, thus inhibiting the formation of hydroxyl radicals and also scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby increasing the levels of reduced glutathione. In addition, LA down-regulates the expression of redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory proteins including TNF and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, LA can scavenge lipid peroxidation products such as hydroxynonenal and acrolein. </span></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; background-color: #ffffff;"> Evidence for a clinical benefit for LA in dementia is yet limited. There are only two published studies, in which 600 mg LA was given daily to 43 patients with AD (receiving a standard treatment with choline-esterase inhibitors) in an open-label study over an observation period of up to 48 months. Whereas the improvement in patients with moderate dementia was not significant, the disease progressed extremely slowly (change in ADAScog: 1.2 points=year, MMSE: -0.6 points=year) in patients with mild dementia (ADAScog</span></blockquote>
<p></p>
<div>This is not double-blind, but the worsening of dementia was much slower than in other long-term studies (being treated with either nothing or choline-esterase inhibitors).</div>
<p></p>
<div>(above cites found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid">Wikipedia</a>)</div>

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 17px; background-color: #ffffff;">Animals treated with alpha-lipoic acid, for example, suffered less brain damage and had a four times greater survival rate after a stroke than animals who did not receive this supplement.</span></blockquote>
<p></p>
<div>Of course, jumping to sustained high doses is premature:</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;">In my personal experience, high dosages of ALA and acetylcarnitine can cause insomnia and ALA may cause heart rhythm disturbances.</span></blockquote>

<p></p>  23andme does a decent job of classifying the strength of evidence, but they probably don&#8217;t account for the poor replication rate, which may be due to data-mining effects (not fixing hypotheses in advance, or doing proper multi-hypothesis significance testing). Failure to do this is little better than fraud, of course. If you lie about the story that lead to your having published a model fit to some data, then that&#8217;s nearly as bad as completely inventing the data. <a href="http://graehl.org/research-by-not-about-liars">see also</a>

			Feynman on Cargo Cult Science</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> from Richard Feynman&#8217;s <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html">1974 commencement address on Cargo Cult Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> There have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on&#8211;with little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before. The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell. He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell. Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues that the rat is really using&#8211;not what you think it&#8217;s using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running. I looked up the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running the rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn&#8217;t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats. But not paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic example of cargo cult science.<p></p> </blockquote>

But the overall good done may be worth it (since it&#8217;s nearly impossible to identify the honest vs. oversold research CVs and proposals). Perhaps if failed reproductions were made public, there could be eventual repercussions - funders could use that track record to reward the researchers with the greatest amount of influential, validated output (as opposed to merely published).

			non-REM Sleep May Renormalize Synapse Strength</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		(not yet studied in mammals)<p></p>
<div>The ratio of the strength of a synapse between neurons and the total potential (from all incoming synapses) needed to activate a neuron may be all that figures; the absolute values may not be important (this is the basis for computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>, though temporal effects, firing rates, and who knows what else also matter in real brains).</div> <p></p>
<div>So you can renormalize (multiply by some constant 1) and see almost no difference except for perhaps greater susceptibility to noise. But at least the amount of physical material needed is smaller, and the energy needed is smaller. It&#8217;s more efficient.</div> <p></p>
<div>In flies and other simple animals studied so far, this definitely happens during sleep. Maybe it happens in humans also. (remains to be studied).</div>
<p></p>
<div>In any case, be careful committing to some REM-sleep only 3hr/day-with-naps sleep schedule, just because you may feel fine at first, when the exact utility of non-REM sleep isn&#8217;t completely known.</div> <p></p>

<p></p>  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://graehl.org/tag/willpower">previously discussed</a> much of this. But some of it is new research.<p></p>  It&#8217;s still possible that the only thing being depleted is glucose available to the brain (which is most readily available from stored liver glycogen, or food). But there may be other chemical resources involved. In any case, weighing and making choices taxes the brain; I&#8217;m not sure how much more or less than e.g. solving puzzles or reading and thinking critically.<p></p>  Quoting from the LessWrong summary:<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">
</span><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">You spend the most willpower when you have to make AND implement your decisions:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">which phase of the decision-making process was most fatiguing? To find out, Kathleen Vohs, a former colleague of Baumeister’s now at the University of Minnesota, performed an experiment using the self-service Web site of Dell Computers. One group in the experiment carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of various features available for a computer — the type of screen, the size of the hard drive, etc. — without actually making a final decision on which ones to choose. A second group was given a list of predetermined specifications and told to configure a computer by going through the laborious, step-by-step process of locating the specified features among the arrays of options and then clicking on the right ones. The purpose of this was to duplicate everything that happens in the postdecisional phase, when the choice is implemented.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The third group had to figure out for themselves which features they wanted on their computers and go through the process of choosing them; they didn’t simply ponder options (like the first group) or implement others’ choices (like the second group). They had to cast the die, and that turned out to be the most fatiguing task of all. When self-control was measured, they were the one who were most depleted, by far</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you reluctant to make trade-offs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Once you’re mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren’t a lot of protracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability and therefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call a cognitive miser, hoarding your energy.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">If you’re shopping, you’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best</em><span> </span>(an especially easy strategy if someone else is paying). Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers who know how to time their sales, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experiments involving tailored suits and new cars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you more likely to take the path of least resistance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">As they started picking features, customers would carefully weigh the choices, but<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">as decision fatigue set in, they would start settling for whatever the default option was. And the more tough choices they encountered early in the process — like going through those 56 colors to choose the precise shade of gray or brown — the quicker people became fatigued and settled for the path of least resistance by taking the default option.</em><span> </span>By manipulating the order of the car buyers’ choices, the researchers found that the customers would end up settling for different kinds of options, and the average difference totaled more than 1,500 euros per car (about $2,000 at the time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Testing willpower depletion in rural Indian villages:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Most of us in America won’t spend a lot of time agonizing over whether we can afford to buy soap, but it can be a depleting choice in rural India. Dean Spears, an economist at Princeton, offered people in 20 villages in Rajasthan in northwestern India the chance to buy a couple of bars of brand-name soap for the equivalent of less than 20 cents. It was a steep discount off the regular price, yet even that sum was a strain for the people in the 10 poorest villages. Whether or not they bought the soap, the act of making the decision left them with less willpower, as measured afterward in a test of how long they could squeeze a hand grip. In the slightly more affluent villages, people’s willpower wasn’t affected significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Decision fatigue can be a factor in trapping people in poverty:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Spears and other researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major — and hitherto ignored — factor in trapping people in poverty. Because<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">their financial situation forces them to make so many trade-offs, they have less willpower to devote to school, work and other activities that might get them into the middle class</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Glucose restores willpower in humans and dogs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">To establish cause and effect, researchers at Baumeister’s lab tried refueling the brain in a series of experiments involving lemonade mixed either with sugar or with a diet sweetener. The sugary lemonade provided a burst of glucose, the effects of which could be observed right away in the lab; the sugarless variety tasted quite similar without providing the same burst of glucose.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">Again and again, the sugar restored willpower, but the artificial sweetener had no effect.</em><span> </span>The glucose would at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completely reverse it. The restored willpower improved people’s self-control as well as the quality of their decisions: they resisted irrational bias when making choices, and when asked to make financial decisions, they were more likely to choose the better long-term strategy instead of going for a quick payoff.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The ego-depletion effect was even demonstrated with dogs in two studies by Holly Miller and Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky. After obeying sit and stay commands for 10 minutes, the dogs performed worse on self-control tests and were also more likely to make the dangerous decision to challenge another dog’s turf</em>. But a dose of glucose restored their willpower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The results of the experiment were announced in January, during Heatherton’s speech accepting the leadership of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the world’s largest group of social psychologists. In his presidential address at the annual meeting in San Antonio, Heatherton reported that administering glucose completely reversed the brain changes wrought by depletion — a finding, he said, that thoroughly surprised him.<em style="font-style: italic;">Heatherton’s results did much more than provide additional confirmation that glucose is a vital part of willpower; they helped solve the puzzle over how glucose could work without global changes in the brain’s total energy use. Apparently ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays less attention to long-term prospects</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Good decision makers structure their lives so as to conserve willpower:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Good decision making is not a trait of the person, in the sense that it’s always there,” Baumeister says. “It’s a state that fluctuates.” His studies show that people with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend</em>. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,” Baumeister points out.</p>
