<div style="">I&#8217;d be furious too, hearing &#8220;nothing you&#8217;ve shown me is even close&#8221; from someone who has nothing constructive.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="">But, people who can&#8217;t make music can have definite musical tastes waiting to be fit with that perfectly arousing key. And they&#8217;d never get anything surprisingly good if they gave specific artistic direction to the composer.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="">I wonder if people are under-creative when following orders by default, and can really benefit from this sort of badgering. I don&#8217;t believe the cliche &#8220;soft bigotry of low expectations&#8221; is generally the right explanation for underachievement, but maybe when it comes to satisfying the boss&#8217;s aesthetic, artistic courage typically earns insulting little rejections-by-tweak.</div>

			Entertainment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div><strong>TV:</strong></div>
<p>The Big Bang Theory - watched it all in the past 3 weeks. Sheldon grew on me.</p>
<p>The Office - still good.</p>
<p>The Boss - excellent acting. Sexy and interesting in the way The Wire was for its first 1.5 seasons.</p>
<div><strong>Music:</strong></div>
<div>
<br>Sufjan Stevens - &#8220;John Wayne Gacy, Jr.&#8221; &#8221;The Seer&#8217;s Tower&#8221; &#8220;To Be Alone with You&#8221;, &#8220;For the Widows in Paradise, for the Fatherless in Ypsilanti&#8221;, &#8220;Sister Winter&#8221; - all excellent</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Books: </strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Stories of Your Life And Others (Ted Chiang) - fantastic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>REAMDE (Neal Stephenson) - diverting. Crichton-like. Too many bad-ass, cool characters. Hard to believe or care about most of it. Too long. Still worth reading.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Movies:</strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Beginners - similar artsy-emo lead as 500 days of summer, but more effectively brooding/poetic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Crazy Stupid Love - in spite of a cheesy closing act (not quite Mrs. Doubtfire - painful, but bad), really funny</div>
<div>
<br>Margin Call - entertaining. Good acting except for the always-boring Demi Moore. I didn&#8217;t care at all for the (Kevin Spacey) moral maybe-I&#8217;ll-be-a-hero hand-wringing. I loved the soundtrack+trading-calls montage at the climax.</div>
<div>
<br>The Secret In Their Eyes - fantastic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Midnight in Paris - good</div>
<p></p>
<div>Whatever Works - good</div>
<div>
<br>X-Men First Class - acceptable. better than the previous disaster.</div>
<div>
<br>Captain America (The First Avenger) - vapid but pretty. Felt like they ran out of money or ended up throwing out scenes - disjointed.</div>
<div>
<br>The Best of Youth (La meglio gioventù) - very good</div>
<p></p>
<div>Capturing the Friedmans - documentary. not recommended. ambiguous mix of overzealous/retarded community+law enforcement witch-hunt of actual creepy pedophile father. may interest people who aren&#8217;t already familiar with witch-hunts.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Lilya 4-ever - good. a bit slow.</div>

We&#8217;ve all experienced paranoid corporate hyper-protectiveness - being ordered off the field in a drizzle because you might slip on the grass and sue (sorry, our insurance contract requires this officiousness!)<p></p>
<div>More generally, we should consider whether &#8216;sending a message&#8217; is worth all the consequences. I wish policymakers  understood this. But &#8216;raising awareness&#8217; usually just makes us feel good. Anyway, supposing you had a sincere-technocrat government (like Clinton&#8217;s was reputed to be), there&#8217;s no forum those technocrats could visit to hear sincere and competent analysis - anywhere power takes consultation becomes clogged with what amount to lobbyists, the best of them appearing to offer quality information and reasoning, indistinguishable from the virtuous impartial academics.</div>

			Lipoic Acid</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>(α-)lipoic acid (LA) is popular as a supplement. We don&#8217;t need any our diet to survive; we synthesize it. It&#8217;s a precursor for necessary mitochondrial enzymes (mitochondria, roughly speaking, burn oxygen to power our bodies). It&#8217;s plausible that beefing up the subtrate of material that&#8217;s used by the enzymes can compensate for their working less efficiently with age (this has been demonstrated in rats).</div>

LA and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, may use their chemical properties as a redox couple to alter protein conformations by forming mixed disulfides.

<div>LA passes easily to the brain; however, it also quickly binds to protein. Unless you take enough (over 150 micromolar), it will ALL be bound to protein. So a single high dose might be needed to get any to the brain. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18655815">via</a>.</div>

<div>LA in vitro acts as a direct antioxidant (of ROS and RNS); also, protein-bound-LA in cells triggers natural anti-oxidant mechanisms (in a more sustained way than if free LA/DHLA were directly scavenging ROS/RNS) and reduces inflammation due to oxidative stress. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18409172">via</a>.</div>

For example, LA increases acetylcholine (ACh) production by activation of choline acetyltransferase and increases glucose uptake, thus supplying more acetyl-CoA for the production of ACh. LA chelates redox-active transition metals, thus inhibiting the formation of hydroxyl radicals and also scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby increasing the levels of reduced glutathione. In addition, LA down-regulates the expression of redox-sensitive pro-inflammatory proteins including TNF and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, LA can scavenge lipid peroxidation products such as hydroxynonenal and acrolein. </span></blockquote>

<p></p>  23andme does a decent job of classifying the strength of evidence, but they probably don&#8217;t account for the poor replication rate, which may be due to data-mining effects (not fixing hypotheses in advance, or doing proper multi-hypothesis significance testing). Failure to do this is little better than fraud, of course. If you lie about the story that lead to your having published a model fit to some data, then that&#8217;s nearly as bad as completely inventing the data. <a href="http://graehl.org/research-by-not-about-liars">see also</a>

			Feynman on Cargo Cult Science</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> from Richard Feynman&#8217;s <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html">1974 commencement address on Cargo Cult Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> There have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on&#8211;with little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before. The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell. He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell. Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues that the rat is really using&#8211;not what you think it&#8217;s using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running. I looked up the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running the rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn&#8217;t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats. But not paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic example of cargo cult science.<p></p> </blockquote>
