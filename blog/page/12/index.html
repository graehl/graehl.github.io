		<p>23andme and other personal genome services make predictions based on research identifying correlations between particular genes and disease or other traits. However, most published studies in the area can&#8217;t (yet) be reproduced:</p>

To answer the first question, they found that only a third (10 of 37) of initial findings were repeated when tested a second time.

<p>The review paper also found that positive replication attempts had much smaller samples (median sample size about 150) than negative replication attempts (median sample size about 380).

<p></p>  23andme does a decent job of classifying the strength of evidence, but they probably don&#8217;t account for the poor replication rate, which may be due to data-mining effects (not fixing hypotheses in advance, or doing proper multi-hypothesis significance testing). Failure to do this is little better than fraud, of course. If you lie about the story that lead to your having published a model fit to some data, then that&#8217;s nearly as bad as completely inventing the data. <a href="http://jonathan.graehl.org/research-by-not-about-liars">see also</a>

			Feynman on Cargo Cult Science</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> from Richard Feynman&#8217;s <a href="http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html">1974 commencement address on Cargo Cult Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: medium;"> There have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on&#8211;with little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before. The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell. He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell. Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues that the rat is really using&#8211;not what you think it&#8217;s using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running. I looked up the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running the rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn&#8217;t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats. But not paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic example of cargo cult science.<p></p> </blockquote>

This analysis revealed that only in ~20–25% of the projects were the relevant published data completely in line with our in-house findings. In almost two-thirds of the projects, there were inconsistencies between published data and in-house data that either considerably prolonged the duration of the target validation process or, in most cases, resulted in termination of the projects&#8230;&#8221;</i></span></blockquote> <a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2011/09/02/how_many_new_drug_targets_arent_even_real.php">via</a>.<p></p>  Of course, just from occasional relative incompetence on the part of pharma lab scientists I&#8217;d expect only a ~70% reproduction rate. And given the rate of attempted vs. accepted publications, and the bias toward publishing positive results, reduce that by another 70% (and this can be eliminated by waiting for multiple confirming studies), and you have about a 50% expected reproduction rate. This leads me to believe that (very rough estimate) half of published medical research is fraudulent.<p></p>  So, the U.S. government is probably funding faux &#8220;research&#8221;, wasting perhaps 50%. But the overall good done may be worth it (since it&#8217;s nearly impossible to identify the honest vs. oversold research CVs and proposals). Perhaps if failed reproductions were made public, there could be eventual repercussions - funders could use that track record to reward the researchers with the greatest amount of influential, validated output (as opposed to merely published).

			non-REM Sleep May Renormalize Synapse Strength</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		(not yet studied in mammals)<p></p>
<div>The ratio of the strength of a synapse between neurons and the total potential (from all incoming synapses) needed to activate a neuron may be all that figures; the absolute values may not be important (this is the basis for computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural networks</a>, though temporal effects, firing rates, and who knows what else also matter in real brains).</div> <p></p>
<div>So you can renormalize (multiply by some constant 1) and see almost no difference except for perhaps greater susceptibility to noise. But at least the amount of physical material needed is smaller, and the energy needed is smaller. It&#8217;s more efficient.</div> <p></p>
<div>In flies and other simple animals studied so far, this definitely happens during sleep. Maybe it happens in humans also. (remains to be studied).</div>
<p></p>
<div>In any case, be careful committing to some REM-sleep only 3hr/day-with-naps sleep schedule, just because you may feel fine at first, when the exact utility of non-REM sleep isn&#8217;t completely known.</div> <p></p>

		<p>Baumeister has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/1594203075/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313659075&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> coming out on willpower. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">NYTimes article</a> about his work, summarized and discussed on <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/75s/link_nytimes_essay_on_willpower_based_on_an/">LessWrong</a>.</p>
<p></p>  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://jonathan.graehl.org/tag/willpower">previously discussed</a> much of this. But some of it is new research.<p></p>  It&#8217;s still possible that the only thing being depleted is glucose available to the brain (which is most readily available from stored liver glycogen, or food). But there may be other chemical resources involved. In any case, weighing and making choices taxes the brain; I&#8217;m not sure how much more or less than e.g. solving puzzles or reading and thinking critically.<p></p>  Quoting from the LessWrong summary:<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">
</span><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">You spend the most willpower when you have to make AND implement your decisions:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">which phase of the decision-making process was most fatiguing? To find out, Kathleen Vohs, a former colleague of Baumeister’s now at the University of Minnesota, performed an experiment using the self-service Web site of Dell Computers. One group in the experiment carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of various features available for a computer — the type of screen, the size of the hard drive, etc. — without actually making a final decision on which ones to choose. A second group was given a list of predetermined specifications and told to configure a computer by going through the laborious, step-by-step process of locating the specified features among the arrays of options and then clicking on the right ones. The purpose of this was to duplicate everything that happens in the postdecisional phase, when the choice is implemented.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The third group had to figure out for themselves which features they wanted on their computers and go through the process of choosing them; they didn’t simply ponder options (like the first group) or implement others’ choices (like the second group). They had to cast the die, and that turned out to be the most fatiguing task of all. When self-control was measured, they were the one who were most depleted, by far</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you reluctant to make trade-offs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Once you’re mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren’t a lot of protracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability and therefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call a cognitive miser, hoarding your energy.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">If you’re shopping, you’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best</em><span> </span>(an especially easy strategy if someone else is paying). Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers who know how to time their sales, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experiments involving tailored suits and new cars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Most of us in America won’t spend a lot of time agonizing over whether we can afford to buy soap, but it can be a depleting choice in rural India. Dean Spears, an economist at Princeton, offered people in 20 villages in Rajasthan in northwestern India the chance to buy a couple of bars of brand-name soap for the equivalent of less than 20 cents. It was a steep discount off the regular price, yet even that sum was a strain for the people in the 10 poorest villages. Whether or not they bought the soap, the act of making the decision left them with less willpower, as measured afterward in a test of how long they could squeeze a hand grip. In the slightly more affluent villages, people’s willpower wasn’t affected significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Spears and other researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major — and hitherto ignored — factor in trapping people in poverty.

The sugary lemonade provided a burst of glucose, the effects of which could be observed right away in the lab; the sugarless variety tasted quite similar without providing the same burst of glucose.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">Again and again, the sugar restored willpower, but the artificial sweetener had no effect.</em><span> </span>The glucose would at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completely reverse it.

Apparently ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays less attention to long-term prospects</em>.</p>

			Narcissistic Leaders Impress but Actually Suck</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		   In an artificial situation where everyone&#8217;s input was valuable, narcissists were seen as more impressive leaders but failed to drive a good decision - probably not bothering to encourage information sharing.<p></p>  Perhaps narcissists value social dominance more than they value group effectiveness (and are more talented at exerting it). Perhaps everyone would value it more if they thought they could claim it, but likely narcissists have acquired a stronger appetite for dominance. So, the experimenters should have offered a large financial incentive for good performance; an intelligent narcissist would then do nothing but persuade people to share information efficiently, and make sure he got credit for doing it.<p></p>  Outside the lab, people who succeed in impressing people probably on average are right to value less the input and judgment of less successful people.<br> <blockquote type="cite">
<div style=""> <blockquote> <p>Although they are generally perceived as arrogant and overly dominant, narcissistic individuals are particularly skilled at radiating an image of a prototypically effective leader. As a result, they tend to emerge as leaders in group settings. Despite people’s positive perceptions of narcissists as leaders, it was thus far unknown if and how leaders’ narcissism is related to the actual performance of those they lead. In the current paper we used a hidden profile paradigm to provide evidence for a discord between the positive image of narcissists as leaders and the reality in terms of group performance. We proposed and found that although narcissistic leaders are perceived as effective due to their displays of authority, leaders’ narcissism actually inhibits information exchange between group members and thereby negatively affects group performance. Our findings thus indicate that perceptions and reality can be at odds, which has important practical and theoretical implications.</p> </blockquote> <p>The study is based on the</p>

Researchers recruited 150 people and put them into groups of three. One person was randomly chosen as the group’s leader, and each group was assigned a task: choosing a job candidate.

Sharing all the information, including what each possessed exclusively, would lead to the best choice. Afterwards, the participants completed questionnaires. The leaders’ questions measured narcissism; the others assessed the leaders’ authority and effectiveness. All checked off the items among the 45 that they knew—indicating how much the group had shared—and rated how well they’d exchanged information. Experimenters tallied the number of shared items, noted the objective quality of the decision, and analyzed these data in relation to the leader’s narcissism.<br> As expected, the group members rated the most narcissistic leaders as most effective.

<p></p>  The brain on the right has so much CSF (brain fluid) that there&#8217;s almost no brain tissue left (in at least one cross section) - the center is hollow; at it&#8217;s thickest, it&#8217;s 2 inches thick. It belongs to a 126 IQ, socially normal university student (circa 1980 - I&#8217;d like to see how he&#8217;s doing now).<p></p>  So, we can be pleased to find such resiliency, but my emotional glass is more empty: I may be accumulating all sorts of brain damage (environmental toxins, alcohol, fever, high-altitude hiking, heading soccer balls, colliding in beach volleyball, cancer, prions, alzheimers lesions) yet feel and act apparently fine, as long as the damage happens gradually enough.

The low-wealth families adopting children end up with smarter offspring than their non-adopting low-wealth counterparts and inversely for high-wealth (for the middle of the pack, there&#8217;s not much difference).<p></p> I believe that nearly all the families (even the poorest) were sufficiently rich and nurturing after childbirth that the differences are due mostly to the quality of the baby. It could be that the poorest (wealthiest) non-adopting parents somehow provide an exceptionally poor (good) prenatal and first-4-months environment, but that&#8217;s odd considering the quality of post-4-months-care is identically sufficient. You would have to believe that prenatal sufficiency is a much higher bar - which is credible; fetal development is probably a delicate thing. If it&#8217;s not in the prenatal or first-4-months environment, it&#8217;s in the genes. That sucks (in terms of being able to hope for technological improvements allowing all to enjoy the priveleges of the rich, that aren&#8217;t eugenic), but appears to be true.
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the genetic or prenatal quality of the adopted children is better or worse, but their combination seems similar to U.S. middle-class.</p>
<p>You can also consider adopted child trying hard enough to get Bs or As in school (harder than a biological child), or sibling competition effects.</p>

		   People sometimes intentionally deaden their facial expressions when they&#8217;re lying. They think they&#8217;ve completely eliminated them, but they&#8217;ve just reduced them. The mouth area is more easily controlled than the brow area (compare to fake smiles lacking the crinkling around the outside of the eyes).

			Carb Binges Against a Low-carb Background</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		   In low carb diets, the protein-&gt;glucose pathway is mostly utilized to fill the liver with glycogen (a long-lasting store of glucose, to feed the brain, and if any is left over, to refill muscle glycogen or store in fat). So it&#8217;s hard to do anything other than lose fat (although with enough dietary fat you may be able to gain).<p></p>  For athletes, eating carbs on workout day, or to near-bursting once or twice a week (following a muscle glycogen depleting workout, possibly), is thought to help maintain or build muscle while losing fat (just cutting calories while maintaining enough protein in diet, you&#8217;ll still lose plenty of muscle mass along with fat mass). I first heard of this from <a href="http://www.lylemcdonald.com/">Lyle McDonald</a> (look for &#8220;depletion workout&#8221; and &#8220;refeed&#8221;). I&#8217;m not sure how strong the evidence is, but there are several plausible mechanisms beyond the claim below that alternating carb-loading and carb-avoiding will increase glycogen storage capacity, which would make for a better low-carb diet experience (more energy available, especially compared to the Atkins-type 50g/day or less of carbs and the accompanying ketosis-only malaise - although I guess burned proteins contribute less to cancer than burned glucose or fat).<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="">Excess amino acids are oxidized for energy. This may be why many people feel a slight surge of energy after a high-protein meal. (A related effect is associated with alcohol consumption, which is often masked by the relaxing effect also associated with alcohol consumption.) Amino acid oxidation is not associated with cancer. Neither is fat oxidation. But glucose oxidation is; this is known as the Warburg effect.<br> <p></p> A high-protein LC approach will not work very well for athletes who deplete major amounts of muscle glycogen as part of their daily training regimens. These folks will invariably need more carbohydrates to keep their performance levels up. Ultimately this is a numbers game. The protein-to-glucose conversion rate is about 2-to-1. If an athlete depletes 300 g of muscle glycogen per day, he or she will need about 600 g of protein to replenish that based only on protein. This is too high an intake of protein by any standard.<p></p>  A recreational exerciser who depletes 60 g of glycogen 3 times per week can easily replenish that muscle glycogen with dietary protein. Someone who exercises with weights for 40 minutes 3 times per week will deplete about that much glycogen each time. Contrary to popular belief, muscle glycogen is only minimally replenished postprandially (i.e., after meals) based on dietary sources. Liver glycogen replenishment is prioritized postprandially. Muscle glycogen is replenished over several days, primarily based on liver glycogen. It is one fast-filling tank replenishing another slow-filling one.<p></p>  Recreational exercisers who are normoglycemic and who do LC intermittently tend to increase the size of their liver glycogen tank over time, via<a href="http://healthcorrelator.blogspot.com/2010/06/compensatory-adaptation-as-unifying.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">compensatory adaptation</a>, and also use more fat (and ketones, which are byproducts of fat metabolism) as sources of energy. Somewhat paradoxically, these folks benefit from regular high carbohydrate intake days (e.g., once a week, or on exercise days), since their liver glycogen tanks will typically store more glycogen. If they keep their liver and muscle glycogen tanks half empty all the time, compensatory adaptation suggests that both their liver and muscle glycogen tanks will over time become smaller, and that their muscles will store more fat.</div></blockquote>

<div style=""> <blockquote> <p>Clinton&#8217;s achievements were a problem. In strategy meetings, he often complained that he had created seven million jobs and cut the deficit but no one seemed to notice. In speeches, he referred to the achievements awkwardly. Our polls showed audiences already knew about them or didn&#8217;t believe they were true.</p> </blockquote> <p>The solution, apparently, was a re-jiggering of language. Morris relates that communications strategist Bob Squier had the following bright idea:</p> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"> <p>The key…was to cite the achievement while talking about something he was going to do. For example: &#8220;The hundred thousand extra police we put on the street can&#8217;t solve the crime problem by themselves; we need to keep anti-drug funding in the budget and stop Republicans from cutting it.&#8221; Or: &#8220;The seven million jobs we&#8217;ve created won&#8217;t be much use if we can&#8217;t find education people to fill them. That&#8217;s why I want a tax deduction for college tuition to help kids go on to college to take those jobs.&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p></p>
<p></p> <p>Linguists of course will recognize that this language is infested with presuppositions—those fascinating linguistic organisms, which because of their<em>presumption</em></p>
<p></p>of truth, head deniability off at the pass. There are no fewer than six distinct, politically-relevant presuppositions in the above brief excerpt. <p>Once you know about the linguistic properties of presuppositions, it seems intuitively natural that they should act as performance-enhancing aids for claims, particularly when it comes to believability. After all, their entire reason for living is to allow the speaker to signal that certain information is already taken for granted as shared knowledge—and if it&#8217;s not, then the hearer should accommodate it post-haste into his set of background assumptions.</p> <p>In fact, psychological studies as far back as the seventies have shown that people can be so eager to accommodate presupposed information that they might even tweak their own memories accordingly. In a study led by memory scientist Elizabeth Loftus, people who&#8217;d witnessed simulated car crashes were more likely to mistakenly remember a stop sign when asked &#8221;<em>Do you remember seeing the stop sign?&#8221;</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

		   I&#8217;ve already observed this in myself. Imprudent action feels like an unwillingness to help future-me at now-me&#8217;s expense.<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite">The researchers asked a group of college seniors — three weeks before graduation — to read a passage that described college graduation either as an event that would prompt a major change in their identities or as an event that would prompt only a relatively trivial change. Compared to students who read the passage describing graduation as a small change, those who read a description of the event as a major change were much more likely to make more impatient choices, choosing to receive a gift certificate worth $120 in the next week rather than wait a year for up to $240.<p></p>  Their work suggests that people can be motivated to hold onto their money, or make more prudent decisions by increasing their sense of connectedness to their future selves, the researchers said.</blockquote> <br> <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/connection-to-your-future-self-impacts-your-financial-decision-making">HT</a>
