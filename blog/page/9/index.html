<div>There are plenty of possible causal mechanisms, detailed <a href="http://donmatesz.blogspot.com/2012/04/harvard-meat-study.html">here</a>. Still no proof of overall causality, but it&#8217;s enough evidence to encourage moderation.</div> <p></p>
<div>Things cooked at high heat (fried, well done, BBQed) are probably additionally unhealthy. </div>

This gave them a baseline from which to calculate participants’ honesty. Those forced to enter their results within 20 seconds, the researchers found, reported a mean roll of 4.6. Those who were not under any time pressure reported a mean roll of 3.9. </span></blockquote>
<p></p>
<div>This in an experiment with a reward of about $10 for lying.</div>
<p></p>
<div>My guess: immediate temptation to cheat for $10 if you think you can get away with it. On reflection, caution accelerates:</div>
<p></p>
<div>1. The gain is small.</div>
<div>2. Maybe people will find out via mechanism X I didn&#8217;t think of (hidden cameras?)</div>
<div>3. maybe my report of 6 will be suspicious. maybe a 5 &#8230; no, may as well just go with my original 3 &#8230;</div>
<div>4. How will I feel having cheated? How good will I feel going away having a story of how I was honest even when it cost me?</div>
<div>5. I want to impress my psych teacher with how honest we college freshmen are.</div>
<div>6. Now that I&#8217;ve hesitated so long, I feel even more cautious. I&#8217;ve spent so much time deliberating, when I could have just taken the extra $5 immediately &#8230; I must actually not want to cheat.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Perhaps also noteworthy: the above experiment was with 3 dice rolls, but the instruction to report the first. In a second experiment with only 1 die roll, the averages result claimed by both the hurry-up and take-your-time groups was 0.2-0.4 lower. This suggest that people in the 3 die roll group felt more comfortable cheating by reporting the 2nd or 3rd roll, perhaps in their mind lamely equating it with what could have been the 1st roll, or having a justification ready of having honestly misunderstood (I doubt anyone did honestly misunderstand). A difference of 0.2 is surely significant (comparing between N=76 and N=74 freshmen under the 3-dice and 1-die conditions).</div>

For instance, it points out that your spouse is the biggest influence on your exercise habits. It also shows that if you want to stay young, &#8220;vigorous aerobic exercise makes your DNA look several decades younger than it is. And that&#8217;s bad news for the sedentary groups.&#8221; In recent years, it&#8217;s been fashionable to dismiss exercise as useless for losing weight, but the reality has been that exercise is important for reasons more than losing weight:</span><br style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);"> <blockquote style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);">Only the diet-plus-exercise group had significant improvements in insulin sensitivity, LDL chloresterol, and distolic blood pressure&#8212;crucial risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, but changes you can&#8217;t measure by looking in the mirror or stepping on a scale&#8230; (Pg. 157)<br> </blockquote>
<span style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);">In addition, the author takes on the typical prescriptions for exercise as being too little to even maintain your weight and not gain weight: &#8220;Managed to avoid significant weight gain throughout the study, and these women averaged a full hour of moderate exercise every day. Anything less was unusuccessful. That&#8217;s a lot of execise&#8212;unless you compare it to the daily lives of our ancestors who didn&#8217;t spend most of the day sitting at desks or in cars.&#8221; (Pg. 160)</span>
</blockquote> <p></p>
<div>Combine this with recurring warnings about savage correlations between long desk-computer-hours and death rate (even after controlling for amount of physical training, etc, although causality is far from proven, yet) , and you have to believe it&#8217;s worth exercising pretty hard and regularly. Failing that, at least eat very little. Getting fat just means more chances to get cancer (along w/ the risk of hard to escape vicious-cycle metabolic syndrome + heart disease + adult-onset diabetes + increased food cravings from increased fat cells that don&#8217;t die off when you lose weight again).</div>

			Memory Is a Series of Hexagonal Tubes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/ge1zprum">via</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubules">hexagonal tubes</a> are 15% of the brain&#8217;s protein. Previously, we knew that long term potentiation of synapses features a hexagonal enzyme, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca2%2B/calmodulin-dependent_protein_kinase">CaMKII</a>, which carries 6 bits of information (presence or absence of phosphorus at each of its 6 corners).<p></p>
<div>The new result is that computer models have shown that the same CaMKII that&#8217;s involved in potentiating synapses, can also fit inside the hexagonal &#8220;microtubules&#8221; and write (or read; probably both - I&#8217;m not clear) the 6 phosphorylation bits in a slice of the microtubule. Probably microtubules, which are long, can hold very many 6-bit bytes.</div> <p></p>
<div>It&#8217;s known that long term memories are lost if recalled and not stored. I could imagine the transfer of molecules from microtubules having this characteristic (if you don&#8217;t put them back when you&#8217;re done, they&#8217;re gone).</div> <p></p>
<div>CaMKII and microtubules exist in non-brain and non-human tissue as well.</div>

			Recuperation Aided by Placebo: How?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>I just skimmed a <a href="http://daedalus2u.blogspot.com/2007/04/placebo-and-nocebo-effects.html">long and detailed explanation</a> of the biochemstry of reacting to beliefs about recovery caused by taking fake treatments. The claim is that when we&#8217;re seriously ill or injured, we&#8217;re either in a resting mode or a fight/flight mode. If we&#8217;re still fighting whatever injured us, our body doesn&#8217;t budget for healing; it suppresses the pain. If we accept that our role is to be laid up and cared for until we recover, then we budget for it (and feel psychologically unable to exert ourselves hard). A placebo treatment definitely makes it seem like our tribe expects us to rest and recuperate - that we&#8217;ll be protected, that it&#8217;s safe to make ourselves sluggish and disabled in a way that can&#8217;t be immediately reversed.</div> <p></p>
<div>I&#8217;ve noticed the tension between fighting and recuperating, subjectively, in my mild soccer injuries. Initially, I&#8217;m not sure about the severity, but for a few seconds at least, I&#8217;m unwilling to move at all, until I can take stock. Later, if I decide to keep competing, it takes a while to overcome the resistance to voluntary movement that the pain signals gave me (I doubt my muscles are so functionally disabled by a kick in the shin). Of course, later, when the match is over, I feel more impaired than when I was fighting, and I doubt it&#8217;s only because of swelling setting in.</div> <br><div>This hypothesis also explains why I&#8217;ve had extremely poor results whenever I lifted weights or otherwise exercised extremely hard when in the beginning or middle of a cold/fever, and perhaps how I&#8217;ve escaped full symptoms by allowing extra sleep when I feel tired after the scratchy-inflamed-throat beginnings of a cold.</div> <p></p>
<div>I wish I knew when it was okay to treat symptoms directly (without that suppression of symptoms suppressing necessary responses to the underlying cause). For example, hospitals that medicate to lower fevers of under 104F kill more of their patients than they save.</div>

<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: rgb(51,102,153); padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; background-color: rgb(255,255,255);"> <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The process within our brains that creates habits is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain ﬁgure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Over time, this loop — cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward — becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become neurologically intertwined until a sense of craving emerges. What’s unique about cues and rewards, however, is how subtle they can be. Neurological studies like the ones in Graybiel’s lab have revealed that some cues span just milliseconds. And rewards can range from the obvious (like the sugar rush that a morning doughnut habit provides) to the infinitesimal (like the barely noticeable — but measurable — sense of relief the brain experiences after successfully navigating the driveway). Most cues and rewards, in fact, happen so quickly and are so slight that we are hardly aware of them at all. But our neural systems notice and use them to build automatic behaviors.</p>
<p></p> Habits aren’t destiny — they can be ignored, changed or replaced. But it’s also true that once the loop is established and a habit emerges, your brain stops fully participating in decision-making. So unless you deliberately ﬁght a habit — unless you ﬁnd new cues and rewards — the old pattern will unfold automatically. [&#8230;] </blockquote>

Take, for instance, a series of studies conducted a few years ago at Columbia University and the University of Alberta. Researchers wanted to understand how exercise habits emerge. In one project, 256 members of a health-insurance plan were invited to classes stressing the importance of exercise. Half the participants received an extra lesson on the theories of habit formation (the structure of the habit loop) and were asked to identify cues and rewards that might help them develop exercise routines.</p>
<p></p> The results were dramatic. Over the next four months, those participants who deliberately identified cues and rewards spent twice as much time exercising as their peers. Other studies have yielded similar results. According to another recent paper, if you want to start running in the morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always putting on your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (like a midday treat or even the sense of accomplishment that comes from ritually recording your miles in a log book). After a while, your brain will start anticipating that reward — craving the treat or the feeling of accomplishment — and there will be a measurable neurological impulse to lace up your jogging shoes each morning.<p></p> Our relationship to e-mail operates on the same principle. When a computer chimes or a smartphone vibrates with a new message, the brain starts anticipating the neurological “pleasure” (even if we don’t recognize it as such) that clicking on the e-mail and reading it provides. That expectation, if unsatisfied, can build until you find yourself moved to distraction by the thought of an e-mail sitting there unread — even if you know, rationally, it’s most likely not important. On the other hand, once you remove the cue by disabling the buzzing of your phone or the chiming of your computer, the craving is never triggered, and you’ll find, over time, that you’re able to work productively for long stretches without checking your in-box.

Now they knew what to look for and saw their mistake in scene after scene. Cleaning has its own habit loops that already exist. In one video, when a woman walked into a dirty room (cue), she started sweeping and picking up toys (routine), then she examined the room and smiled when she was done (reward). In another, a woman scowled at her unmade bed (cue), proceeded to straighten the blankets and comforter (routine) and then sighed as she ran her hands over the freshly plumped pillows (reward). P.&amp; G. had been trying to create a whole new habit with Febreze, but what they really needed to do was piggyback on habit loops that were already in place. The marketers needed to position Febreze as something that came at the end of the cleaning ritual, the reward, rather than as a whole new cleaning routine.</p>
<p></p> The company printed new ads showing open windows and gusts of fresh air. More perfume was added to the Febreze formula, so that instead of merely neutralizing odors, the spray had its own distinct scent. Television commercials were filmed of women, having finished their cleaning routine, using Febreze to spritz freshly made beds and just-laundered clothing. Each ad was designed to appeal to the habit loop: when you see a freshly cleaned room (cue), pull out Febreze (routine) and enjoy a smell that says you’ve done a great job (reward). When you finish making a bed (cue), spritz Febreze (routine) and breathe a sweet, contented sigh (reward). Febreze, the ads implied, was a pleasant treat, not a reminder that your home stinks. <p></p> And so Febreze, a product originally conceived as a revolutionary way to destroy odors, became an air freshener used once things are already clean. The Febreze revamp occurred in the summer of 1998. Within two months, sales doubled. A year later, the product brought in $230 million. Since then Febreze has spawned dozens of spinoffs — air fresheners, candles and laundry detergents — that now account for sales of more than $1 billion a year. Eventually, P.&amp; G. began mentioning to customers that, in addition to smelling sweet, Febreze can actually kill bad odors. Today it’s one of the top-selling products in the world.

The study found that when someone marries, he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When a couple move into a new house, they’re more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal. When they divorce, there’s an increased chance they’ll start buying different brands of beer.</p>
<p></p> Consumers going through major life events often don’t notice, or care, that their shopping habits have shifted, but retailers notice, and they care quite a bit. At those unique moments, Andreasen wrote, customers are “vulnerable to intervention by marketers.” In other words, a precisely timed advertisement, sent to a recent divorcee or new homebuyer, can change someone’s shopping patterns for years.

<p></p> I had got into a bad habit of going to the cafeteria every afternoon and eating a chocolate-chip cookie, which contributed to my gaining a few pounds. Eight, to be precise. I put a Post-it note on my computer reading “NO MORE COOKIES.” But every afternoon, I managed to ignore that note, wander to the cafeteria, buy a cookie and eat it while chatting with colleagues. Tomorrow, I always promised myself, I’ll muster the willpower to resist.<p></p> Tomorrow, I ate another cookie.<p></p>When I started interviewing experts in habit formation, I concluded each interview by asking what I should do. The first step, they said, was to figure out my habit loop. The routine was simple: every afternoon, I walked to the cafeteria, bought a cookie and ate it while chatting with friends.<p></p> Next came some less obvious questions: What was the cue? Hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? And what was the reward? The taste of the cookie itself? The temporary distraction from my work? The chance to socialize with colleagues?<p></p> Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings, but we’re often not conscious of the urges driving our habits in the first place. So one day, when I felt a cookie impulse, I went outside and took a walk instead. The next day, I went to the cafeteria and bought a coffee. The next, I bought an apple and ate it while chatting with friends. You get the idea. I wanted to test different theories regarding what reward I was really craving. Was it hunger? (In which case the apple should have worked.) Was it the desire for a quick burst of energy? (If so, the coffee should suffice.) Or, as turned out to be the answer, was it that after several hours spent focused on work, I wanted to socialize, to make sure I was up to speed on office gossip, and the cookie was just a convenient excuse? When I walked to a colleague’s desk and chatted for a few minutes, it turned out, my cookie urge was gone.<p></p> All that was left was identifying the cue.<p></p>Deciphering cues is hard, however. Our lives often contain too much information to figure out what is triggering a particular behavior. Do you eat breakfast at a certain time because you’re hungry? Or because the morning news is on? Or because your kids have started eating? Experiments have shown that most cues fit into one of five categories: location, time, emotional state, other people or the immediately preceding action. So to figure out the cue for my cookie habit, I wrote down five things the moment the urge hit:<p></p> Where are you? (Sitting at my desk.)<p></p>What time is it? (3:36 p.m.)<p></p>What’s your emotional state? (Bored.)<p></p>Who else is around? (No one.)<p></p>What action preceded the urge? (Answered an e-mail.)<p></p> The next day I did the same thing. And the next. Pretty soon, the cue was clear: I always felt an urge to snack around 3:30.<p></p>Once I figured out all the parts of the loop, it seemed fairly easy to change my habit. But the psychologists and neuroscientists warned me that, for my new behavior to stick, I needed to abide by the same principle that guided Procter &amp; Gamble in selling Febreze: To shift the routine — to socialize, rather than eat a cookie — I needed to piggyback on an existing habit. So now, every day around 3:30, I stand up, look around the newsroom for someone to talk to, spend 10 minutes gossiping, then go back to my desk. The cue and reward have stayed the same. Only the routine has shifted. It doesn’t feel like a decision, any more than the M.I.T. rats made a decision to run through the maze. It’s now a habit. I’ve lost 21 pounds since then (12 of them from changing my cookie ritual). </blockquote>
