			Early AM Waking During Puberty Inflicts Lasting Harm</a>

Since start times may be correlated with other determinants of test scores, I also estimate the effect using only variation in start times within schools over time and ﬁnd a two percentile point improvement. The effect of start times on academic performance is robust to different speciﬁcations and sources of variation. The magnitude of the effect is similar to the difference in test scores for one additional year of parental education.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The impact of later start times on test scores is persistent. Conditional on a high school ﬁxed effect, a one hour later start time in grade eight is associated with an increase in test scores in grade ten similar in magnitude to the increase in grade eight. … The impact of start times is greatest in grade eight (who are more likely to have begun puberty than those in the sixth or seventh grade</p> </div></div></blockquote> With a later school start time, kids will sleep later and better. This is crucial at the onset of puberty. The size of the effect is about 2% (on test scores). It carries forward to later years. It&#8217;s unclear how much this harm (which persists years later) is in merely lost learning (that could be made up) as opposed to lasting physical damage.<p></p>  I was definitely permanently harmed by waking at 5:30am for over a year, to attend daily Mormon bible study (it&#8217;s supposed to run through all of high school, to protect us from the bad influences of less-conservative non-Mormon high school peers). I quit the church for other reasons, but in retrospect wish I had quit seminary immediately. I was 11-12 years old at the time and not close to fully grown. Sure, I would sometimes manage to sleep before 11pm, but others aren&#8217;t asleep by then, which makes it difficult, and even if they are, I often wanted to do my solitary things more than I wanted to sleep (not looking forward to the next morning, and wanting to prolong the sweet freedom of being awake).

<p></p>  Apparently that&#8217;s what the earth&#8217;s surface would look like if there were no tides or currents. Not as spherical as I thought. Naturally we should expect a bulge toward the equator since the Earth rotates, but there&#8217;s not as much radial symmetry as I&#8217;d imagined. <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/earths-gravity-revealed-in-unprecedented-detail">Source</a><p></p>  I was a little shocked at how non-ellipsoid the geoid is, so I finally looked it up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid">on Wikipedia</a>:
<blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 19px; font-family: sans-serif;">the geoid is by definition a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 19px; font-family: sans-serif;">Pretty straightforward. The point about how the ocean would be if there were no currents is more or less irrelevant. I guess any small change in the surface of the Earth wouldn&#8217;t greatly affect the plumb line. It&#8217;s also possible that the geoid surface will submerge below actual continents or even ocean floor - the plumb line dictates it. That dented upper left portion in the image must feel like a local hill, gravitationally, when you go over it - that is, I don&#8217;t think you can take any image of Earth from space, that has this apparent dented shape (and it&#8217;s not just the ocean and atmosphere rounding things out).</span></p>

			Our Especially Life-friendly Planet Means We Should Be Less Surprised by the Lack of Alien Visitors and More Optimistic About Avoiding Self-caused Apocalpyse</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      How many alien planets have intelligent life now? How many have ever had it? How long does an intelligent species usually survive? How cheap can interstellar travel become, and how hard is it to make the necessary discoveries?<p></p>  These are all interesting questions that are somewhat constrained by our observations: in the last 50 or so years we&#8217;ve been watching, we&#8217;ve seen no evidence of lightspeed messages, and, crackpot stories aside, no alien or alien-device visitors. It can&#8217;t be the case that intelligent species arise from nearly every one of billions of stars in our galaxy, that last a long time, and discover effective interstellar travel, or we&#8217;d have been colonized or visited already (surely not all of them would be cautiously isolationist). The argument that we haven&#8217;t recognized any signals isn&#8217;t too convincing to me, because efficient use of limited spectrum means that the signal should look like random noise (excessive regularities indicate a wasteful encoding).<p></p>  I mention this to introduce a cool synthetic (computer model only) experiment that suggests that our planet is extremely fortunately stable in its climate, which of course encourages (like in rainforests) diverse and interdependent species. It&#8217;s not a stretch to think that after a radical environmental change, humans would be extinct, but some simpler forms would survive. Of course, we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find that we live in precisely the type of environment that makes intelligent life more likely than usual. In fact, any seemingly-odd coincidence (e.g. that we have a tide-locked moon orbiting us that shows the same hemisphere, give or take, at all times), may be well explained by such an effect (of course, truly meaningless coincidences are possible too).<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 55); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">Three separate tests are investigated: (1) Earth-Moon properties and their effect on obliquity; (2) Individual planet locations and their effect on eccentricity variation; (3) The overall structure of the Solar System and its effect on eccentricity variation. In all three cases, the actual Earth/Solar System has unusually low [large-scale astronomically-caused climate change] frequencies compared to similar alternative systems. All three results are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% or better level, and the probability of all three occurring by chance is less than 10^-5</span></span></blockquote> - <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2010.0475">Testing Anthropic Selection: A Climate Change Example</a><p></p>  1 in 10000 isn&#8217;t THAT amazing, but it is cool. This doesn&#8217;t mean the odds of life in an earth-like planet are 1 in 10000; far from it. It means that we should expect to find similarly stable long-term climate conditions 1 in 10000 times. Also, don&#8217;t forget that this is *given* an earth-like planet (we don&#8217;t know how exactly how frequent those are in our galaxy etc. - yet).<p></p>  found via <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/planetary-filter-found.html">Robin Hanson</a> - the comments so far there don&#8217;t really discuss the post; people are just using it as a forum to share their pet views on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">anthropics</a><p></p>  On learning that our solar system is unusually well-suited to developing intelligent life, we should feel less worried about the likelihood of intelligent civilizations failing before they can broadcast for long, or develop interstellar travel+colonization, as suggested by the low apparent frequency of alien visits to us. The less likely intelligent life is to arise, the happier we should be. Advanced aliens are scary. Unlike the movies, we won&#8217;t win. I&#8217;d hope they are merciful, and able to trust us or contain us without destroying us.<p></p>  Of course, in some sense &#8220;less worried&#8221; is meaningless. If there&#8217;s not much you can do about a worry, hopefully you weren&#8217;t dwelling on it. Most of us probably don&#8217;t have the right estimate (and estimate of uncertainty of that estimate) of the likelihood of our civilization imploding, or aliens invading, before we learned of this evidence; if your estimates were vague enough to begin with, then you still won&#8217;t have a sharp belief even after many such pieces of suggestive anthropic evidence.

Research shows that the average male ratio is about .98, and a ratio of about .94 would be regarded as especially masculine, while a ratio of 1.00 would be viewed as more feminine. For women, the average ratio is about 1.00, and a score of about .98 would be regarded as more masculine &#8230;<br> </span></span></blockquote> I had a ratio of .94 in each hand; a female friend had a ratio of 1.02 in her left hand and 0.98 in her right. Different ratios across hands is relatively unusual, but it&#8217;s characteristic of (a small sample of) famous comedians (although the trend is in the direction of a larger ratio for the right hand, not the left).<p></p>  People describe their pets as having similar personalities to themselves. On average, people who owned fish self-described as happiest, dog owners as the most fun to be with (obviously they experience the joy of using their dog as an attention magic in public), cat owners as the most dependable and emotionally sensitive (most cat owners are female?), and reptile owners the most independent (?).<p></p>  People with bumper stickers are aggressive tailgaters and likely road ragers.<p></p>  If you lace your fingers together then put one thumb over the other, if your dominant hand&#8217;s thumb goes on top, you&#8217;re probably left-brain (verbal/analytical) dominant. (I normally am, although I happened to have the other thumb on top at the time I read this).<p></p>  &#8220;Evening people&#8221; are more extroverted, noncomforming, intuitive, and impulsive. &#8220;Morning people&#8221; are more introverted, self-controlled, and eager to please. (as self-identified by when you say you feel best sleeping/waking with no external constraints). I think there are all sorts of confounds (what are you really learning when someone says they would choose to be a morning person? probably that they got used to waking up early for a 8:30-5:30pm job, which tells you a lot about them). In other words, the problems with these questionnaire studies is that you&#8217;re learning something about their life, but not necessarily anything fundamental (if their circumstances change, but their fundamental personality doesn&#8217;t, their answers will probably change a bit).<p></p>  <h3>Recap of key advice:<br> </h3> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

This, in turn, can cause them to be more optimistic about the future and can improve their physical health.</p> </div></div></blockquote> This worked for me.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

Those who give a few dollars to the needy, buy a small surprise gift for a loved one, donate blood, or help a friend are inclined to experience a fast-acting and significant boost in happiness.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Acting in a way where you feel like you&#8217;re taking care of people is rewarding.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

Seeing their own reflection makes them more aware of their body and more likely to eat food that is good for them.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Didn&#8217;t try this. I don&#8217;t have a problem in that area if I don&#8217;t buy &#8220;pleasure&#8221; foods that actually make me feel bad when I overindulge.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

The plants help reduce stress and induce good moods, which, in turn, promote creativity.</p> </div></div></blockquote> I&#8217;ve had a plant for ages.

<strong>Touch People Lightly on The Upper Arm</strong>.</h3> <p class="nonindent" style="font-size: 1em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.7em; text-indent: inherit; margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Lightly touching someone on their upper arm makes them far more likely to agree to a request because the touch is unconsciously perceived as a sign of high status. In one dating study, the touch produced a 20 percent increase in the number of people who accepted an invitation to dance in a nightclub and a 10 percent increase in those who would give their telephone number to a stranger on the street.</p> </div></div></blockquote> I feel good when I do this.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

Such “expressive writing” results in partners’ using more positive language when they speak to each other, leading to a healthier and happier relationship</p> </div></div></blockquote> If you commit any feelings or thoughts to paper it solidifies them in some way (&#8220;I&#8217;m the person who said they feel X&#8221; will make me feel X more.

<strong>Deal with Potential Liars by Closing Your Eyes and Asking for an E-mail</strong>.</h3> <p class="nonindent" style="font-size: 1em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.7em; text-indent: inherit; margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">The most reliable cues to lying are in the words that people use, with liars tending to lack detail, use more “ums” and “ahs,” and avoid self-references (“me,” “mine,” “I”). In addition, people are about 20 percent less likely to lie in an e-mail than in a telephone call, because their words are on record and so are more likely to come back and haunt them.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Some people are excellent liars and are quite specific, fast-talking, and confident. I guess this is good for detecting mostly-honest people making an uncharacteristic fib. But I like the tip about email for suspected expert liars.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

You must have tried very hard”) encourages them to try regardless of the consequences, therefore sidestepping fear of failure. This, in turn, makes them especially likely to attempt challenging problems, find these problems enjoyable, and try to solve them on their own time.</p> </div></div></blockquote> I didn&#8217;t read this chapter (I don&#8217;t plan on being a parent any time soon), but that seems smart.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;">

<strong>Visualize Yourself Doing, Not Achieving</strong>.</h3> <p class="nonindent" style="font-size: 1em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.7em; text-indent: inherit; margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">People who visualize themselves taking the practical steps needed to achieve their goals are far more likely to succeed than those who simply fantasize about their dreams becoming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
</div>a reality. One especially effective technique involves adopting a third-person perspective: those who visualize themselves as others see them are about 20 percent more successful than those who adopt a first-person point of view. </div></blockquote> Cool. I forgot to try this. My dad says he likes to think of himself as he&#8217;s being perceived (physically) when he interacts with people. That&#8217;s a special and unusual type of multitasking. Perhaps becoming comfortable with that leads to more confidence. I don&#8217;t know whether this really helps with long term goals, but I guess this advice is backed by (sloppy and then loosely interpreted) actual studies.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">
<strong>Consider Your Legacy</strong>.</h3> <p class="nonindent" style="font-size: 1em; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.7em; text-indent: inherit; margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Asking people to spend just a minute imagining a close friend standing up at their funeral and reflecting on their personal and professional legacy helps them to identify their long-term goals and assess the degree to which they are progressing toward making those goals a reality.</p> </div></div></blockquote> <br> This seems to be about having a relatively satisfied experience of dying slowly of some disease, assuming you haven&#8217;t already lost brain function. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s what I want to optimize for, but I&#8217;ll keep it in mind if I can&#8217;t otherwise decide.<p></p>  This reminds me of people reporting that they took some big risk, starting a company, because someone advised them &#8220;20 years from now will you look back and regret not taking that risk?&#8221; - but consider the downside: &#8220;20 years from now will you look back and wonder what you missed out on because you made that risky choice that ended up really costing you?&#8221;.

			Self Control Pisses Me Off?</a>

In a series of clever studies, the Northwestern psychologists David Gal and Wendy Liu demonstrate that the exertion of self-control doesn’t just make it harder for us to contain our own anger – it also make us more interested in watching anger-themed movies, or thinking about anger-related information, or looking an angry facial expressions. In other words, acts of self-control haven’t just exhausted the ego – they actually seem to have pissed it off.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">My favorite experiment involved movies. Two hundred and thirty nine subjects were given a choice between a virtuous apple and a hedonistic chocolate bar. (A slim majority chose the apple.) Then, they were offered a selection of movies to watch, from Anger Management (an anger themed film) to Billy Madison (a non-anger themed film.) Interestingly, students were significantly more likely to choose the angry films if they’d first chosen the apple. And it wasn’t just films: another experiment found that people who exercised financial restraint – they chose a gift certificate for groceries over one for spa services – were more interested in looking at angry faces.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">What’s driving this effect? Gal and Liu argue that the preference for angry stuff is not simply a result of ego depletion. Instead, they speculate that self-control is inherently aggravating. Perhaps choosing the apple annoys us because our goals have been thwarted – we really wanted the candy bar – or maybe we’re pissed because we feel that our sense of autonomy has been diminished. (If we weren’t so constrained by societal norms and expectations, we would have gorged on chocolate.) The point is that the labor of self-control directly inspires our tendency towards anger, and not indirectly via a worn down prefrontal cortex.</p> </div></div></blockquote> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1749711">paper</a><p></p>  also, 2007 <a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Enjdewa2/DeWalletalJESP2007.pdf">study</a><p></p>  I&#8217;ve discussed evidence that <a href="">self-control is weakly trainable</a>, which is of similar quality. So I&#8217;m not inspired (yet) to live a life of soft indulgence alone.

			Never Get Fat. If You&#8217;re Fat, Lose Weight.</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		       <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">Using data from the <a href="http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">Framingham Heart Study</a>, 5209 participants were followed up for 48 years from 1948. The current study however only included participants who were free from pre-existing diseases of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The research showed that for those who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and 14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for those who had never been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration of obesity (more than 15 years). Furthermore, the research showed for every additional two years lived with obesity, the risk of mortality increased by between six and seven per cent</span></span></blockquote> <br> <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/mu-tlw032011.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/mu-tlw032011.php</a><p></p>  Of course this is correlation, but I&#8217;ll weakly bet that it&#8217;s causal. Even briefly being extremely fat means you&#8217;re more likely to die (for the rest of your life). You have something like a permanent 100% increase in relative mortality risk (how likely you are to drop dead each day) if you&#8217;re fat for 7 years (but then lose the weight). After that, it&#8217;s more like 4% per year you stay fat. I don&#8217;t know how quickly the risk concentrates in the first year of getting fat, but it&#8217;s probably front-loaded. I also don&#8217;t know if yo-yo fattening/defattening is worse.<p></p>  You should never get fat. Another reason not to, is that fat cells are hormonally active, and don&#8217;t retire when you lose weight; they just become less full of lipds (like an empty balloon). Supposedly an empty fat cell creates roughly as much hunger as a full one. (I don&#8217;t remember the evidence for this, but I believe it).<p></p>  Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t mean stay model-skinny. Just don&#8217;t get fat.

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/">Let the Right One In</a> was an excellent book, and a good foreign film. Matt Reeves rewrote it as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228987/">Let Me In</a>. It&#8217;s been several months since I saw the foreign version, but this one seems significantly better constructed for the screen - I wasn&#8217;t surprised to hear that the director is the same as the (re)writer. <p></p>  Some cumbersome (for film) elements were pruned or reworked, but it&#8217;s actually slightly longer due to some slow pacing. It&#8217;s dark and beautiful. Both versions are worth watching, but the story does lose impact when you see everything coming. My first exposure, the book, was the most moving.<p></p>  There&#8217;s a little bit of awkwardly animated CG footage. Yes, strong little things can move quickly, but I didn&#8217;t like the overall effect.

Or if you sleep less, maybe the sleep spindles become more densely packed per hour of shut-eye, just like REM sleep. I do agree that you should expect to lose out in a big way on 6 hours/night of sleep, though (even for one night).

			Conclusions About Longevity From 80 Years of Gifted Kids Dying at Various Ages</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A long-running study of ~1500 &#8220;gifted&#8221; (high IQ test) people suggests that a lot of what&#8217;s believed about long-lived people is false. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594630755?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=graehl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594630755">The Longevity Project: Surprising Discoveries for Health and Long Life from the Landmark Eight-Decade Study</a> seems to be based on trustworthy data (even though the original researcher, now dead, was interested for reasons now-shameful eugenic hopes, he has a reputation for honest analysis of his data). Here&#8217;s the press release &#8220;MYTHS EXPLODED!&#8221; summary of the book:</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote>

This is one of &#8220;the biggest bombshells of the project,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>
<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">&#8220;We keep hearing this advice to cheer up and stay happy because it will keep you healthy,&#8221; Friedman says. &#8220;We just disagree with that after seeing the results of the study.&#8221;</p>
<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">The participants who lived long, happy lives &#8220;were not cynical rebels and loners&#8221; but accomplished people who were satisfied with their lives. Many knew that worrying is sometimes a good thing. The authors also looked at a study of Medicare patients that found that &#8220;neuroticism was health-protective.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People think this mostly because excessive stress is known to be extremely unhealthy. But moderate amounts of (reasonable) worry my have benefits that outweigh the health cost, or as far as I know, it could even be unhealthy to have too-low stress as well.</p>

<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;"><strong>Reality:</strong>Being active in middle age was most important to health and longevity in the study. But rather than vow to do something to get in shape (like jogging) and then hate it and not stick with it, find something you like to do.</p>

It&#8217;s the ones who had activities at one point and had the pattern of keeping them &#8230; They were doing stuff that got them out of the chair &#8230; whether it was gardening, walking the dog or going to museums.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think they mean that a consistent habit of a little physical activity is sufficient for most of the benefits, and that a short-lived enthusiasm for ultra-marathons won&#8217;t count for as much as the same work spread out over a larger time.</p>

They say the most obvious reason &#8220;is that conscientious people do more things to protect their health and engage in fewer activities that are risky.&#8221;</p>

The young adults who were thrifty, persistent, detail-oriented and responsible lived the longest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the obvious reason. You should be fun (it&#8217;s attractive and satisfying), but also avoid real danger.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s by now accepted folk wisdom that people who feel like they have nothing to live for, don&#8217;t live long. The dog in Where the Red Fern Grows who lays down and refuses to eat after her brother dies, etc.</p>

<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">The married men in the study lived the longest. Single men outlived remarried men but didn&#8217;t live as long as married men. Among women, the number who divorced their husbands and stayed single lived nearly as long as steadily married women.</p>
<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">&#8220;Being divorced was much less harmful to a women&#8217;s health,&#8221; the authors say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Women live longer and function better at extreme age. So typically the old man is benefiting from the care of his more competent wife. If she leaves him, he&#8217;s definitely worse off. I think it&#8217;s as simple as that. But it&#8217;s also my experience that men stay hurt for longer when a romantic relationship ends.</p>
<p></p>  By the way, intelligence is correlated with health, for at least the reason that most things that damage your health also damage your intelligence. (Intelligence is the sum of very many small things, genetic and expressed, functioning properly).

<p></p>  Excessive levels of stress are known to be extremely damaging (see the canonical survey: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716732106?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=graehl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0716732106">Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers</a>).
<h4>Defusing anger</h4>
<p>Acting on anger doesn&#8217;t reduce anger (short term). It <a href="">primes</a> more anger. People were more cruel to innocents after being allowed to &#8220;vent&#8221; by wailing on a boxing bag with a picture of someone they hated.</p>
<p></p>  Finding benefits (&#8220;silver lining&#8221;) to misfortunes definitely makes people feel better. It also makes you more likely to forgive. As sad as it seems to engage in biased thinking, it might be worth it for the health benefits, if you don&#8217;t have the will or way to exact revenge instead (I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s also satisfying, but you&#8217;ll have a hard time finding psychologists wanting to show *that* in an experiment).<p></p>  Example benefits - whatever you&#8217;re fuming about may also have helped you:<p></p>

<h4>Stress-reduction</h4>
<p>Praying for others (probably generalizes to spending time imagining/wanting good things for those you love) seems to defuse your own stress and worries. Probably by means of comparing your problems to others&#8217;, but perhaps also by some general positive-mood boosting that comes from caring. Or it could always be the magical power of prayer, I suppose :)</p>
<p></p>  Classical music (at least, baroque) decreases blood pressure where nothing, pop, and jazz don&#8217;t.<p></p>  If the weather is nice, spend 30 minutes outside in the sun. Mood and memory will improve. (because of walking, because of sun, because of seeing people, or because of scene? no idea why. probably sun.)<p></p>  Use humor to cope with stress. Expose yourself to things that make you smile/laugh.
<h4>Dogs</h4>
<p>When treated with dog ownership (i.e. intervention, not correlation), blood pressure decreases. Dogs are more effective than blood pressure drugs. People with a dog and spouse performed better in the presence of their dog than their spouse. Possible mechanisms: daily walking, emotional attachment, silent &#8220;listener&#8221;, petting=happiness, socializing w/ people because your dog attracts them. Except for scary dogs, people will smile and chat more if you have one, than if you carry a teddy bear or plant.</p>
<p></p>  Cats also made people less depressed but didn&#8217;t give the same mood-boosting effect as dogs. This inclines me to believe that socializing with humans is one of the most likely mechanisms behind the dog treatment.<p></p>  Correlation: cat owners are more likely to die in the year following a heart attack. Dog owners are more likely to live (maybe not causation).<p></p>  Females sitting with a dog get more passerby-attention in a park than those blowing bubbles or watching TV.<p></p>  Seniors in retirement homes with a robot toy dog (AIBO) had their loneliness treated as well as by a real dog.<p></p>  Videos of cute animals help people relax.<p></p> 
<h4>Alcohol</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve noted before that many studies show that <a href="">drinkers live longer</a>, and that it may even be causal (many, but not all, alternate correlated causes have been controlled for). One of the strongest uncontrolled-for confounds is that people who drink more tend to socialize more, which is known to be extremely health-promoting.</p>
<p></p>  Further, part of the stress, insecurity, and inhibition reduction behind drinking is pure placebo effect and priming. A control group given placebo alcoholic groups at a bar showed similar (negative) drunk-markers as those given real alcohol. Presumably some of the positive ones hold as well (it&#8217;s well known that most uses of modern drugs are effective mainly as a placebo; the difference between traditional and modern medicine is that the modern procedure is sometimes actually necessary and effective beyond placebo).<p></p> 
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>It helps if you believe exercise helps.</p>
<p></p>  Hotel employees who clean rooms get a decent amount of exercise. Telling them how many calories various activities burned caused them to lose weight (without making them report exercising more outside of their job, or changing dietary/drug habits). This is somewhat mysterious, but for sure they identified (compared to the control group) with being people who had all sorts of healthy exercise in their life, which either boosted their spontaneous physical activity (at job or otherwise), or otherwise acted as a powerful placebo medication promoting weight loss and lowered blood pressure (often considered a proxy for stress). It probably made them feel slightly better about their job.<p></p>  So, you can make a list of time spent on average in various calorie-burning everyday activities. That might help you feel better about your life, or somehow derive more actual exercise benefits in your usual routine. e.g. walking, biking, housework, shopping, reading, sitting (yes, this burns calories; even sleeping does), sex, driving, talking on the phone, showering, standing, playing, etc (all of these are in the range of 1-10 cal/minute)

<p></p>
<em>Psychological Science</em>, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sexual excitement, hunger, thirst—psychological scientists have found that activation of just one of these bodily desires can actually make people want other, seemingly unrelated, rewards more. Take, for example, a man who finds himself searching for a bag of potato chips after looking at sexy photos of women. If this man were able to suppress his sexual desire in this situation, would his hunger also subside? This is the sort of question Mirjam Tuk, of the University of Twente in the Netherlands, sought to answer in the laboratory.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tuk came up with the idea for the study while attending a long lecture. In an effort to stay alert, she drank several cups of coffee. By the end of the talk, she says, “All the coffee had reached my bladder. And that raised the question: What happens when people experience higher levels of bladder control?” With her colleagues, Debra Trampe of the University of Groningen and Luk Warlop of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Tuk designed experiments to test whether self-control over one bodily desire can generalize to other domains as well.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In one experiment, participants either drank five cups of water (about 750 milliliters), or took small sips of water from five separate cups. Then, after about 40 minutes—the amount of time it takes for water to reach the bladder—the researchers assessed participants’ self-control. Participants were asked to make eight choices; each was between receiving a small, but immediate, reward and a larger, but delayed, reward. For example, they could choose to receive either $16 tomorrow or $30 in 35 days.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The researchers found that the people with full bladders were better at holding out for the larger reward later. Other experiments reinforced this link; for example, in one,<b> just thinking about words related to urination triggered the same effect</b>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“You seem to make better decisions when you have a full bladder,” Tuk says. So maybe you should drink a bottle of water before making a decision about your stock portfolio, for example. Or perhaps stores that count on impulse buys should keep a bathroom available to customers, since they might be more willing to go for the television with a bigger screen when they have an empty bladder.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Bolded part seems to control somewhat against merely more-hydrated =&gt; patience.

			More 59 Seconds</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I&#8217;ve said <a href="">before</a>, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307474860?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=graehl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307474860">59 Seconds</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=graehl-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307474860" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1">. I&#8217;m trusting the author to fairly summarize the research, even though I know he&#8217;ll sometimes over-sell it.</p>
<p></p> 
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<p>This chapter was a little less exciting for me. It mostly seems to be about people brainstorming in groups.</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Unconscious mind</h4>
<p>Distract your conscious mind when you&#8217;re stuck. Or just put the task away and come back later (especially in a different environment). At the very least, this may allow you to let go of a fixed mental box. Track a dot as it moves across the monitor (the saccadic eye exercise in <a href="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/">Brain Workshop</a> might do, even though it&#8217;s not continuous motion). Watch cars or birds as they move across your window.</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Encourage analogy</h4>
<p>Look for advice from similar situations. Think of how some other person does something like what you want to do. Change of perspective, or just useful clues? It should help, either way. Imagine what happens if you did the opposite of what you think will help.</p>
<h4>Flowers and plants</h4>
<p>These help encourage creativity and play. Why? Doesn&#8217;t matter. Red is associated with danger, green with positivity and relaxation. Green ink -&gt; 30% more anagrams solved than red ink (maybe red is harder to see, too). But on the other hand, pictures or video windows of nature scenes don&#8217;t work well. Green paint might help.</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Fresh Blood</h4>
<p>In groups, rotating out a new collaborator helps on average. Maybe this is just because in the study, the transaction was to take 1 person out of each group and move them to the next, on the same task. So naturally this person would be stealing all the cool (types of) ideas from their previous group. But I still have a weak belief that this helps beyond that effect (or maybe the study did control for it by using different people or tasks).</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Priming</h4>
<p>Priming matters a lot in general. Our brain associates things with other things. Trigger one thing and it triggers associated things.</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;">Put people in front of computer wallpaper showing dollar symbols, and they behave in a more selfish and unfriendly way, giving less money to charity and sitting farther away from others.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn017" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">17</sup></a><span> </span>Give interviewers a cup of iced coffee, and they unknowingly rate interviewees as colder and less pleasant.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn018" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">18</sup></a><span> </span>Add a faint smell of cleaning fluid to the air, and people tidy up more thoroughly.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn019" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">19</sup></a><span> </span>Put a briefcase on a table during a meeting, and people suddenly become more competitive.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn020" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">20</sup></a></span></span></blockquote>
<p><br> So, expect to be inspired by watching or thinking about other great creators. Or, glance at a piece of art that suggests creativity. A picture with 12 identically colored crosses inspired less creativity than one with 1 of the 12 colored differently. Images like these are somehow &#8220;creative-priming&#8221; compared to the boring all-same versions:</p>
<p></p>  <div class="p_embed p_image_embed">

</div>
 <p></p>  Pull yourself toward your desk to increase creativity. Push down on the desk to decrease it (we have a long association of pushing away things we don&#8217;t like).<p></p>  If you&#8217;re more stressed, you&#8217;ll be less creative (more focused). All stress is physical, but there are different types, still. The brain uses blood. Different parts of the brain are boosted/suppressed by stress. People unscramble anagrams (10%) faster when lying down than when standing up - probably because of physical stress.<p></p>  (from Seth Roberts: if you&#8217;re walking on a treadmill, you&#8217;ll enjoy studying more; standing up is no help. suggests walking/learning priming)<p></p> 
<h3>Attraction</h3>
<p>Cookies taken from a nearly-empty jar taste better than cookies from a full jar (scarcity).</p>
<p></p>  Researchers failed to produce any measurable &#8220;hard to get&#8221; attraction effect from first contacts in online dating. Since that failed, they tried enlisting prostitutes; also no effect.<p></p>  However, if you appear to be GENERALLY hard to get but SPECIFICALLY easy for your mark, then they are more excited about you (because you probably won&#8217;t reject or publicly humiliate them, but you won&#8217;t embarrass them with your reputation of being easy; you&#8217;re a more impressive prize).<p></p>  For females: latex bra inserts. A cup: 13, faked B cup: 19, faked C cup: 44 (approaches by men in a nightclub), and 15%,18%,24% (hitchhiking success rate).<p></p>  Touch the upper arm of someone you need help from. Brief touch = 20% more successful panhandling. I don&#8217;t think this is all intimidation. This also makes women (and probably men) more receptive to cold approaches, even in public (physically attractive, confident young men apparently have a 20% success rate in getting a woman&#8217;s number after an appearance-compliment and offer for drinks that night, but only 10% without touching).<p></p>  Touching is high status and dominant, even if not intimidating to the recipient.
<p>Succesful men and women in speed-dating get people talking about themselves, with fun/offbeat queries, probably because they&#8217;re a refreshing change from the conventional interaction (and fun/playful/leading people are attractive).</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;">“If you were on a hit show, who would you be?” </span><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;">“If you were a pizza topping, what would you be?”</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>Mimic someone (repeat exactly their words back to them, or just their body language), and they report feeling a closer emotional bond. Don&#8217;t be too obvious and they won&#8217;t notice.</p>
<p></p>  People seem to be able to detect that you act interested in everyone (in a speed-dating environment, irrespective of whether they eavesdrop or are just perceptive of your progression with them implying a fixed agenda). They hate that. Maybe you&#8217;ll be unfaithful, or maybe it means you&#8217;re low status and grateful for anything you can get.<p></p>  Women avoid (in planning on long-term commitment) men who seem too attractive AND too high status, probably figuring they won&#8217;t be able to keep them.<p></p>  Women claim kindness is what they&#8217;re looking for. What they really want is bravery. For impressing women, rock climbing, skateboard/snowboard/bmx/etc, soccer, and hiking are attractive. Aerobic and golf aren&#8217;t. For impressing men, aerobics, yoga, gym (but not bodybuilding).<p></p>  Scary first date = they think they&#8217;re excited about you.<p></p>  Get them to disclose personal info. It will need to be reciprocal, and if it wasn&#8217;t safe small-talk, you&#8217;ll feel intimate. For example:

<p>I don&#8217;t know if I believe this. It&#8217;s normally risky to talk shit about others; people associate the shit with you. But maybe that doesn&#8217;t apply given attraction, or given that they agree.</p>

<h4>In relationships</h4>
<p>Active listening almost never happens (&#8220;I understand the way you feel when you say XYZ &#8230;&#8221;) and so isn&#8217;t useful in predicting breakups in real relationships. Maybe it would help if you could do it.</p>

Males who are able to accept some of these ideas, and therefore show a sense of power sharing with their partner, are far more likely to maintain a successful relationship. In contrast, couples in which the males react by stonewalling, or even showing contempt, are especially likely to break up.</span></span></blockquote>

Then you&#8217;ll tend to express more positive things to your partner.<p></p>  Think about how others&#8217; relationships are worse than yours. This will make you happier with yours than if you only think of what&#8217;s good about it in isolation.<p></p>  If you have some real criticism of your partner, follow it with &#8220;but [a reason it somehow it makes me love them]&#8221;.<p></p>  Keep cool objects in the entertaining-room those that have a history with your partner (gift, shared purchase, vacation, etc.)<p></p>  Thinking about your love for your partner should decrease your specific interest in sexy bodies.<br> <span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;"> </span></span>

			Non-traditional (Genetic Algorithm) Circuit Design; Unconnected Neurons Exerting Influence on Neighbors</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		      <a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits">http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits</a><p></p>  A programmable chip (FPGA) loaded with the right program (code &#8216;evolved&#8217; by an overseer measuring task performance to choose winners, with random sexual combination of code items in a generation) can reliably classify an analog signal with a far simpler design than any human-constructed approach.<p></p>  Unfortunately, the code may only work for the particular physical substrate (programmable chip) it was evolved on, in that it exploits idiosyncrasies in that particular chip.<p></p>  One particular winning program produced disconnected loops, that nonetheless were influenced by electromagnetism at distance from nearby circuits, and were essential to task performance.<p></p>  You could still mass produce such devices by running the evolution on each somewhat-unique chip, seeding it with successful codes from other chips.<p></p>  They use no clock signal; making changes only happen on transitions of a global clock signal is one of the ways abstract, designed programs can execute reproducibly in spite of small variations in the manufactured substrate (it&#8217;s also possible to design clockless circuits that converge reliably, but that&#8217;s not as often practiced).<p></p>  The human brain almost certainly enjoys such efficiencies (compared to rigid, computer-programming-like design). Just a few weeks ago <a href="http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13401">Caltech researchers found actual evidence</a> of changes in neural activity from influences in disconnected neurons in proximity (in rats), under normal (not epileptic) conditions - &#8221;<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2727.html">Ephaptic coupling of cortical neurons</a>&#8221;<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: verdana,tahoma,lucinda grande,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;"></span></span>. I don&#8217;t know if this mechanism will turn out to be essential to modeling our brains&#8217; computation. This is definitely analogous to the useful disconnected circuit in the winning evolved FPGA design; if the learning reinforcement is supplied reliably by other already-working parts of the brain, neural &#8216;circuits&#8217; could even arise by an analogous mechanism.
