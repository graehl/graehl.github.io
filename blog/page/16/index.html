			Self Control Pisses Me Off?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; font-size: small;"> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">A brand new paper, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, extends this link between self-control and anger, even as it complicates the ego-depletion model. In a series of clever studies, the Northwestern psychologists David Gal and Wendy Liu demonstrate that the exertion of self-control doesn’t just make it harder for us to contain our own anger – it also make us more interested in watching anger-themed movies, or thinking about anger-related information, or looking an angry facial expressions. In other words, acts of self-control haven’t just exhausted the ego – they actually seem to have pissed it off.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">My favorite experiment involved movies. Two hundred and thirty nine subjects were given a choice between a virtuous apple and a hedonistic chocolate bar. (A slim majority chose the apple.) Then, they were offered a selection of movies to watch, from Anger Management (an anger themed film) to Billy Madison (a non-anger themed film.) Interestingly, students were significantly more likely to choose the angry films if they’d first chosen the apple. And it wasn’t just films: another experiment found that people who exercised financial restraint – they chose a gift certificate for groceries over one for spa services – were more interested in looking at angry faces.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">What’s driving this effect? Gal and Liu argue that the preference for angry stuff is not simply a result of ego depletion. Instead, they speculate that self-control is inherently aggravating. Perhaps choosing the apple annoys us because our goals have been thwarted – we really wanted the candy bar – or maybe we’re pissed because we feel that our sense of autonomy has been diminished. (If we weren’t so constrained by societal norms and expectations, we would have gorged on chocolate.) The point is that the labor of self-control directly inspires our tendency towards anger, and not indirectly via a worn down prefrontal cortex.</p> </div></div></blockquote> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1749711">paper</a><p></p>  also, 2007 <a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Enjdewa2/DeWalletalJESP2007.pdf">study</a><p></p>  I&#8217;ve discussed evidence that <a href="">self-control is weakly trainable</a>, which is of similar quality. So I&#8217;m not inspired (yet) to live a life of soft indulgence alone.

			Never Get Fat. If You&#8217;re Fat, Lose Weight.</a>

The current study however only included participants who were free from pre-existing diseases of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The research showed that for those who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and 14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for those who had never been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration of obesity (more than 15 years). Furthermore, the research showed for every additional two years lived with obesity, the risk of mortality increased by between six and seven per cent</span></span></blockquote> <br> <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/mu-tlw032011.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/mu-tlw032011.php</a><p></p>  Of course this is correlation, but I&#8217;ll weakly bet that it&#8217;s causal. Even briefly being extremely fat means you&#8217;re more likely to die (for the rest of your life). You have something like a permanent 100% increase in relative mortality risk (how likely you are to drop dead each day) if you&#8217;re fat for 7 years (but then lose the weight). After that, it&#8217;s more like 4% per year you stay fat. I don&#8217;t know how quickly the risk concentrates in the first year of getting fat, but it&#8217;s probably front-loaded. I also don&#8217;t know if yo-yo fattening/defattening is worse.<p></p>  You should never get fat. Another reason not to, is that fat cells are hormonally active, and don&#8217;t retire when you lose weight; they just become less full of lipds (like an empty balloon). Supposedly an empty fat cell creates roughly as much hunger as a full one. (I don&#8217;t remember the evidence for this, but I believe it).<p></p>  Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t mean stay model-skinny. Just don&#8217;t get fat.

		      <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/">Let the Right One In</a> was an excellent book, and a good foreign film. Matt Reeves rewrote it as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228987/">Let Me In</a>. It&#8217;s been several months since I saw the foreign version, but this one seems significantly better constructed for the screen - I wasn&#8217;t surprised to hear that the director is the same as the (re)writer. <p></p>  Some cumbersome (for film) elements were pruned or reworked, but it&#8217;s actually slightly longer due to some slow pacing. It&#8217;s dark and beautiful. Both versions are worth watching, but the story does lose impact when you see everything coming. My first exposure, the book, was the most moving.<p></p>  There&#8217;s a little bit of awkwardly animated CG footage. Yes, strong little things can move quickly, but I didn&#8217;t like the overall effect.

Or if you sleep less, maybe the sleep spindles become more densely packed per hour of shut-eye, just like REM sleep. I do agree that you should expect to lose out in a big way on 6 hours/night of sleep, though (even for one night).

			Conclusions About Longevity From 80 Years of Gifted Kids Dying at Various Ages</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A long-running study of ~1500 &#8220;gifted&#8221; (high IQ test) people suggests that a lot of what&#8217;s believed about long-lived people is false. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594630755?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=graehl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594630755">The Longevity Project: Surprising Discoveries for Health and Long Life from the Landmark Eight-Decade Study</a> seems to be based on trustworthy data (even though the original researcher, now dead, was interested for reasons now-shameful eugenic hopes, he has a reputation for honest analysis of his data). Here&#8217;s the press release &#8220;MYTHS EXPLODED!&#8221; summary of the book:</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; text-align: left;"> </span></span>

This is one of &#8220;the biggest bombshells of the project,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>
<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">&#8220;We keep hearing this advice to cheer up and stay happy because it will keep you healthy,&#8221; Friedman says. &#8220;We just disagree with that after seeing the results of the study.&#8221;</p>
<p class="inside-copy" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 64px; padding: 0px 0px 1em; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">The participants who lived long, happy lives &#8220;were not cynical rebels and loners&#8221; but accomplished people who were satisfied with their lives. Many knew that worrying is sometimes a good thing. The authors also looked at a study of Medicare patients that found that &#8220;neuroticism was health-protective.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People think this mostly because excessive stress is known to be extremely unhealthy. But moderate amounts of (reasonable) worry my have benefits that outweigh the health cost, or as far as I know, it could even be unhealthy to have too-low stress as well.</p>

But rather than vow to do something to get in shape (like jogging) and then hate it and not stick with it, find something you like to do.</p>

It&#8217;s the ones who had activities at one point and had the pattern of keeping them &#8230; They were doing stuff that got them out of the chair &#8230; whether it was gardening, walking the dog or going to museums.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think they mean that a consistent habit of a little physical activity is sufficient for most of the benefits, and that a short-lived enthusiasm for ultra-marathons won&#8217;t count for as much as the same work spread out over a larger time.</p>

The young adults who were thrifty, persistent, detail-oriented and responsible lived the longest.</p>

<p>I agree with the obvious reason. You should be fun (it&#8217;s attractive and satisfying), but also avoid real danger.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s by now accepted folk wisdom that people who feel like they have nothing to live for, don&#8217;t live long. The dog in Where the Red Fern Grows who lays down and refuses to eat after her brother dies, etc.</p>

<p>Women live longer and function better at extreme age. So typically the old man is benefiting from the care of his more competent wife. If she leaves him, he&#8217;s definitely worse off. I think it&#8217;s as simple as that. But it&#8217;s also my experience that men stay hurt for longer when a romantic relationship ends.</p>
<p></p>  By the way, intelligence is correlated with health, for at least the reason that most things that damage your health also damage your intelligence. (Intelligence is the sum of very many small things, genetic and expressed, functioning properly).

<p></p>  Excessive levels of stress are known to be extremely damaging (see the canonical survey: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716732106?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=graehl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0716732106">Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers</a>).
<h4>Defusing anger</h4>
<p>Acting on anger doesn&#8217;t reduce anger (short term). It <a href="">primes</a> more anger. People were more cruel to innocents after being allowed to &#8220;vent&#8221; by wailing on a boxing bag with a picture of someone they hated.</p>
<p></p>  Finding benefits (&#8220;silver lining&#8221;) to misfortunes definitely makes people feel better. It also makes you more likely to forgive. As sad as it seems to engage in biased thinking, it might be worth it for the health benefits, if you don&#8217;t have the will or way to exact revenge instead (I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s also satisfying, but you&#8217;ll have a hard time finding psychologists wanting to show *that* in an experiment).<p></p>  Example benefits - whatever you&#8217;re fuming about may also have helped you:<p></p>

<h4>Stress-reduction</h4>
<p>Praying for others (probably generalizes to spending time imagining/wanting good things for those you love) seems to defuse your own stress and worries. Probably by means of comparing your problems to others&#8217;, but perhaps also by some general positive-mood boosting that comes from caring. Or it could always be the magical power of prayer, I suppose :)</p>
<p></p>  Classical music (at least, baroque) decreases blood pressure where nothing, pop, and jazz don&#8217;t.<p></p>  If the weather is nice, spend 30 minutes outside in the sun. Mood and memory will improve. (because of walking, because of sun, because of seeing people, or because of scene? no idea why. probably sun.)<p></p>  Use humor to cope with stress. Expose yourself to things that make you smile/laugh.
<h4>Dogs</h4>
<p>When treated with dog ownership (i.e. intervention, not correlation), blood pressure decreases. Dogs are more effective than blood pressure drugs. People with a dog and spouse performed better in the presence of their dog than their spouse. Possible mechanisms: daily walking, emotional attachment, silent &#8220;listener&#8221;, petting=happiness, socializing w/ people because your dog attracts them. Except for scary dogs, people will smile and chat more if you have one, than if you carry a teddy bear or plant.</p>
<p></p>  Cats also made people less depressed but didn&#8217;t give the same mood-boosting effect as dogs. This inclines me to believe that socializing with humans is one of the most likely mechanisms behind the dog treatment.<p></p>  Correlation: cat owners are more likely to die in the year following a heart attack. Dog owners are more likely to live (maybe not causation).<p></p>  Females sitting with a dog get more passerby-attention in a park than those blowing bubbles or watching TV.<p></p>  Seniors in retirement homes with a robot toy dog (AIBO) had their loneliness treated as well as by a real dog.<p></p>  Videos of cute animals help people relax.<p></p> 
<h4>Alcohol</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve noted before that many studies show that <a href="">drinkers live longer</a>, and that it may even be causal (many, but not all, alternate correlated causes have been controlled for). One of the strongest uncontrolled-for confounds is that people who drink more tend to socialize more, which is known to be extremely health-promoting.</p>
<p></p>  Further, part of the stress, insecurity, and inhibition reduction behind drinking is pure placebo effect and priming. A control group given placebo alcoholic groups at a bar showed similar (negative) drunk-markers as those given real alcohol. Presumably some of the positive ones hold as well (it&#8217;s well known that most uses of modern drugs are effective mainly as a placebo; the difference between traditional and modern medicine is that the modern procedure is sometimes actually necessary and effective beyond placebo).<p></p> 
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>It helps if you believe exercise helps.</p>
<p></p>  Hotel employees who clean rooms get a decent amount of exercise. Telling them how many calories various activities burned caused them to lose weight (without making them report exercising more outside of their job, or changing dietary/drug habits). This is somewhat mysterious, but for sure they identified (compared to the control group) with being people who had all sorts of healthy exercise in their life, which either boosted their spontaneous physical activity (at job or otherwise), or otherwise acted as a powerful placebo medication promoting weight loss and lowered blood pressure (often considered a proxy for stress). It probably made them feel slightly better about their job.<p></p>  So, you can make a list of time spent on average in various calorie-burning everyday activities. That might help you feel better about your life, or somehow derive more actual exercise benefits in your usual routine. e.g. walking, biking, housework, shopping, reading, sitting (yes, this burns calories; even sleeping does), sex, driving, talking on the phone, showering, standing, playing, etc (all of these are in the range of 1-10 cal/minute)

<p></p>
<em>Psychological Science</em>, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sexual excitement, hunger, thirst—psychological scientists have found that activation of just one of these bodily desires can actually make people want other, seemingly unrelated, rewards more. Take, for example, a man who finds himself searching for a bag of potato chips after looking at sexy photos of women. If this man were able to suppress his sexual desire in this situation, would his hunger also subside? This is the sort of question Mirjam Tuk, of the University of Twente in the Netherlands, sought to answer in the laboratory.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tuk came up with the idea for the study while attending a long lecture. In an effort to stay alert, she drank several cups of coffee. By the end of the talk, she says, “All the coffee had reached my bladder. And that raised the question: What happens when people experience higher levels of bladder control?” With her colleagues, Debra Trampe of the University of Groningen and Luk Warlop of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Tuk designed experiments to test whether self-control over one bodily desire can generalize to other domains as well.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In one experiment, participants either drank five cups of water (about 750 milliliters), or took small sips of water from five separate cups. Then, after about 40 minutes—the amount of time it takes for water to reach the bladder—the researchers assessed participants’ self-control. Participants were asked to make eight choices; each was between receiving a small, but immediate, reward and a larger, but delayed, reward. For example, they could choose to receive either $16 tomorrow or $30 in 35 days.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The researchers found that the people with full bladders were better at holding out for the larger reward later. Other experiments reinforced this link; for example, in one,<b> just thinking about words related to urination triggered the same effect</b>.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">“You seem to make better decisions when you have a full bladder,” Tuk says. So maybe you should drink a bottle of water before making a decision about your stock portfolio, for example. Or perhaps stores that count on impulse buys should keep a bathroom available to customers, since they might be more willing to go for the television with a bigger screen when they have an empty bladder.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Bolded part seems to control somewhat against merely more-hydrated =&gt; patience.

			More 59 Seconds</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I&#8217;ve said <a href="">before</a>, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307474860?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=graehl-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307474860">59 Seconds</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=graehl-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307474860" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1">. I&#8217;m trusting the author to fairly summarize the research, even though I know he&#8217;ll sometimes over-sell it.</p>
<p></p> 
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<p>This chapter was a little less exciting for me. It mostly seems to be about people brainstorming in groups.</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Unconscious mind</h4>
<p>Distract your conscious mind when you&#8217;re stuck. Or just put the task away and come back later (especially in a different environment). At the very least, this may allow you to let go of a fixed mental box. Track a dot as it moves across the monitor (the saccadic eye exercise in <a href="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/">Brain Workshop</a> might do, even though it&#8217;s not continuous motion). Watch cars or birds as they move across your window.</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Encourage analogy</h4>
<p>Look for advice from similar situations. Think of how some other person does something like what you want to do. Change of perspective, or just useful clues? It should help, either way. Imagine what happens if you did the opposite of what you think will help.</p>
<h4>Flowers and plants</h4>
<p>These help encourage creativity and play. Why? Doesn&#8217;t matter. Red is associated with danger, green with positivity and relaxation. Green ink -&gt; 30% more anagrams solved than red ink (maybe red is harder to see, too). But on the other hand, pictures or video windows of nature scenes don&#8217;t work well. Green paint might help.</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Fresh Blood</h4>
<p>In groups, rotating out a new collaborator helps on average. Maybe this is just because in the study, the transaction was to take 1 person out of each group and move them to the next, on the same task. So naturally this person would be stealing all the cool (types of) ideas from their previous group. But I still have a weak belief that this helps beyond that effect (or maybe the study did control for it by using different people or tasks).</p>
<p></p> 
<h4>Priming</h4>
<p>Priming matters a lot in general. Our brain associates things with other things. Trigger one thing and it triggers associated things.</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;">Put people in front of computer wallpaper showing dollar symbols, and they behave in a more selfish and unfriendly way, giving less money to charity and sitting farther away from others.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn017" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">17</sup></a><span> </span>Give interviewers a cup of iced coffee, and they unknowingly rate interviewees as colder and less pleasant.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn018" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">18</sup></a><span> </span>Add a faint smell of cleaning fluid to the air, and people tidy up more thoroughly.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn019" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">19</sup></a><span> </span>Put a briefcase on a table during a meeting, and people suddenly become more competitive.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-fn020" class="hlink" style="color: #2e4560 ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">20</sup></a></span></span></blockquote>
<p><br> So, expect to be inspired by watching or thinking about other great creators. Or, glance at a piece of art that suggests creativity. A picture with 12 identically colored crosses inspired less creativity than one with 1 of the 12 colored differently. Images like these are somehow &#8220;creative-priming&#8221; compared to the boring all-same versions:</p>
<p></p>  <div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Wise_9780307593269_epub_003_r1" src="/images/2011/03/01/more-59-seconds/22347184-Wise_9780307593269_epub_003_r1.jpg">

</div>
 <p></p>  Pull yourself toward your desk to increase creativity. Push down on the desk to decrease it (we have a long association of pushing away things we don&#8217;t like).<p></p>  If you&#8217;re more stressed, you&#8217;ll be less creative (more focused). All stress is physical, but there are different types, still. The brain uses blood. Different parts of the brain are boosted/suppressed by stress. People unscramble anagrams (10%) faster when lying down than when standing up - probably because of physical stress.<p></p>  (from Seth Roberts: if you&#8217;re walking on a treadmill, you&#8217;ll enjoy studying more; standing up is no help. suggests walking/learning priming)<p></p> 
<h3>Attraction</h3>
<p>Cookies taken from a nearly-empty jar taste better than cookies from a full jar (scarcity).</p>
<p></p>  Researchers failed to produce any measurable &#8220;hard to get&#8221; attraction effect from first contacts in online dating. Since that failed, they tried enlisting prostitutes; also no effect.<p></p>  However, if you appear to be GENERALLY hard to get but SPECIFICALLY easy for your mark, then they are more excited about you (because you probably won&#8217;t reject or publicly humiliate them, but you won&#8217;t embarrass them with your reputation of being easy; you&#8217;re a more impressive prize).<p></p>  For females: latex bra inserts. A cup: 13, faked B cup: 19, faked C cup: 44 (approaches by men in a nightclub), and 15%,18%,24% (hitchhiking success rate).<p></p>  Touch the upper arm of someone you need help from. Brief touch = 20% more successful panhandling. I don&#8217;t think this is all intimidation. This also makes women (and probably men) more receptive to cold approaches, even in public (physically attractive, confident young men apparently have a 20% success rate in getting a woman&#8217;s number after an appearance-compliment and offer for drinks that night, but only 10% without touching).<p></p>  Touching is high status and dominant, even if not intimidating to the recipient.
<p>Succesful men and women in speed-dating get people talking about themselves, with fun/offbeat queries, probably because they&#8217;re a refreshing change from the conventional interaction (and fun/playful/leading people are attractive).</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;">“If you were on a hit show, who would you be?” </span><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;">“If you were a pizza topping, what would you be?”</span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>Mimic someone (repeat exactly their words back to them, or just their body language), and they report feeling a closer emotional bond. Don&#8217;t be too obvious and they won&#8217;t notice.</p>
<p></p>  People seem to be able to detect that you act interested in everyone (in a speed-dating environment, irrespective of whether they eavesdrop or are just perceptive of your progression with them implying a fixed agenda). They hate that. Maybe you&#8217;ll be unfaithful, or maybe it means you&#8217;re low status and grateful for anything you can get.<p></p>  Women avoid (in planning on long-term commitment) men who seem too attractive AND too high status, probably figuring they won&#8217;t be able to keep them.<p></p>  Women claim kindness is what they&#8217;re looking for. What they really want is bravery. For impressing women, rock climbing, skateboard/snowboard/bmx/etc, soccer, and hiking are attractive. Aerobic and golf aren&#8217;t. For impressing men, aerobics, yoga, gym (but not bodybuilding).<p></p>  Scary first date = they think they&#8217;re excited about you.<p></p>  Get them to disclose personal info. It will need to be reciprocal, and if it wasn&#8217;t safe small-talk, you&#8217;ll feel intimate. For example:

<p><br> Get a tame woman to accompany you and dote on you, laughing at your jokes, etc. When she slips away, the other women will want you.</p>
<p><br> Act lukewarm at first (I&#8217;m generally hard to get) but warm, peaking toward the end (but I&#8217;m really into you).</p>
<p></p>  Slow developing, real smiles. Tilt your head (note: I actually looked this study up. It&#8217;s students scoring CG characters on a screen. But there&#8217;s an indirect citation to Frey 1999 that actually talks about (laterally?) tilting your head toward either who you&#8217;re looking at or talking to; unfortunately it&#8217;s in German).<p></p>  College students&#8217; first impressions: women want a man with 2 previous partners (but not more) and men want a woman with 4. 0 is bad.<p></p>  Sustained eye contact =&gt; attraction.

<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">Rather than chatting about topics that you both like, try talking about things you both dislike – people feel closer to each other when they agree about dislikes rather than likes.</span></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I believe this. It&#8217;s normally risky to talk shit about others; people associate the shit with you. But maybe that doesn&#8217;t apply given attraction, or given that they agree.</p>

<h4>In relationships</h4>
<p>Active listening almost never happens (&#8220;I understand the way you feel when you say XYZ &#8230;&#8221;) and so isn&#8217;t useful in predicting breakups in real relationships. Maybe it would help if you could do it.</p>

Males who are able to accept some of these ideas, and therefore show a sense of power sharing with their partner, are far more likely to maintain a successful relationship. In contrast, couples in which the males react by stonewalling, or even showing contempt, are especially likely to break up.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. You could just as well say that reasonable demands from the female are necessary in order for the man to be able to please.</p>
<p></p>  New joint activity involving physical contact. Dancing, if you haven&#8217;t been.<p></p>  Men estimate how pleased a woman will be by some stereotypical romantic gesture more pessimistically than women.<p></p>  Identified as maximally romantic by some portion of women:<p></p>

			Non-traditional (Genetic Algorithm) Circuit Design; Unconnected Neurons Exerting Influence on Neighbors</a>

		      <a href="http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits">http://www.damninteresting.com/on-the-origin-of-circuits</a><p></p>  A programmable chip (FPGA) loaded with the right program (code &#8216;evolved&#8217; by an overseer measuring task performance to choose winners, with random sexual combination of code items in a generation) can reliably classify an analog signal with a far simpler design than any human-constructed approach.<p></p>  Unfortunately, the code may only work for the particular physical substrate (programmable chip) it was evolved on, in that it exploits idiosyncrasies in that particular chip.<p></p>  One particular winning program produced disconnected loops, that nonetheless were influenced by electromagnetism at distance from nearby circuits, and were essential to task performance.<p></p>  You could still mass produce such devices by running the evolution on each somewhat-unique chip, seeding it with successful codes from other chips.<p></p>  They use no clock signal; making changes only happen on transitions of a global clock signal is one of the ways abstract, designed programs can execute reproducibly in spite of small variations in the manufactured substrate (it&#8217;s also possible to design clockless circuits that converge reliably, but that&#8217;s not as often practiced).<p></p>  The human brain almost certainly enjoys such efficiencies (compared to rigid, computer-programming-like design). Just a few weeks ago <a href="http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13401">Caltech researchers found actual evidence</a> of changes in neural activity from influences in disconnected neurons in proximity (in rats), under normal (not epileptic) conditions - &#8221;<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2727.html">Ephaptic coupling of cortical neurons</a>&#8221;<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: verdana,tahoma,lucinda grande,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;"></span></span>. I don&#8217;t know if this mechanism will turn out to be essential to modeling our brains&#8217; computation. This is definitely analogous to the useful disconnected circuit in the winning evolved FPGA design; if the learning reinforcement is supplied reliably by other already-working parts of the brain, neural &#8216;circuits&#8217; could even arise by an analogous mechanism.

			In Defense of the Fabulously Rich</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/02/our-worthy-overlords.html">Robin Hanson</a>, my favorite intellectual provocateur, says that the super-rich are almost always virtuous. I&#8217;m inclined to agree, except that the type of virtue in making lots of money can involve malfeasance, self-serving negligence, and fraud - Enron, Pfizer (Vioxx), various banks encouraging non-scrutiny of fraudulent home assessments and income declarations, mortgage-backed-securities and credit default swaps, poisonous baby formula and toothpaste, unsafe counterfeit rock-climbing gear, etc. <p></p>  I don&#8217;t know how frequent such occurrences are (reporting them is crowd pleasing, so I can&#8217;t just think &#8216;I hear about it all the time, so it must be really common!&#8217;), but to the extent that we effectively punish such crimes by removing most of the perpetrators&#8217; wealth, then it would be even more true that the presently rich are likely virtuous. <p></p>  For some reason, often only a fraction of a criminal&#8217;s wealth is removed, even though violent or drug crimes of lesser harm result in the entirety of a person&#8217;s freedom being removed. I also assume that people trying to win in competitive businesses are routinely guilty of lies, collusion, etc., but that&#8217;s just part of the game and not part of the &#8216;virtue&#8217; meant.<p></p>  I&#8217;m not sure that, aside from Gates+friends&#8217; recent push to secure large donations (50% of wealth?) from many of the so-rich-they-can-afford-it, we should expect successful rich people to be especially selfless. One of the reasons many modestly wealthy people have so much as they do is from a practice of selfish frugality. I don&#8217;t equate charity with virtue, but it does seem fantastic that Gates+friends are trying to spend money in a way that improves more human lives (by more), instead of just donating to the poorest U.S. citizens who are competent to apply for aid (whose biggest problem, I presume, is the terrible behavior of their neighbors, and not a lack of medical care, food, safe water, internet access, etc.).<p></p>  I suppose it is bad for middle-class U.S. citizens if the rich decide that they want to use their influence to secure lower tax rates (on the rich) so they can spend more helping foreign poor. Naturally, the rich are still spending plenty of money on status and pleasure goods, but I think it&#8217;s fair of them to have little allegiance to their native country.

			Meditation Followup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		I got tired of reading the book on Vipassana meditation. It&#8217;s mostly nonsense. <p></p> My mostly-certain judgments: <p></p> The idea that &#8220;not caring&#8221; is always the ideal direction is silly. <p></p> The idea of being really aware of what&#8217;s going on in your mind, rather than being driven by emotional repulsion fields, and especially by childish do-not-want! feelings toward the way things really are in relation to you, is beautiful and what I&#8217;ve already always aspired to. <p></p> The idea that actively resting from activity allows training in the above, and/or is more restorative than simply adding extra (quality) sleep time, is unsettled in my mind. I&#8217;ve definitely achieved significant pleasure in resting while being observant of how I feel (meditating, in some sense; but I didn&#8217;t invest a lot of time really following their specific advice so can&#8217;t fairly say how effective it is, except that I don&#8217;t find their advice in general to be well-motivated beyond &#8216;trust us, we spent a lot of time trying different things&#8217;). But that awake-rest is more pleasurable and interesting than real sleep only because I can&#8217;t remember much of what goes on when I&#8217;m asleep. It doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s more physically helpful or even likely to form new insights more effectively. <p></p> I guess in the same way that people may choose to spend time on various drugs, because they can reach different states of mind there, if I wanted variety for variety&#8217;s sake, I might want a few minutes daily of meditation. Whether or not it&#8217;s better on average than the alternatives (sleep or activity), it&#8217;s at least different. <p></p> As an example of things that meditation subtracts time from, other than sleep, I&#8217;ve started &#8216;composing&#8217; music (improvising using a keyboard and instrument samples, really). During this time I&#8217;m not thinking about myself at all. I doubt I&#8217;m improving at anything other than imagining sounds and mapping sounds to the requisite finger movements (it&#8217;s thought that focused practice, and learning in general, may preserve or amplify some global brain attributes, but I doubt anyone&#8217;s proved it). But it feels nice in moderation, and I can&#8217;t say my life would be any better if I meditated instead. Almost any time I&#8217;d be tempted to meditate, I&#8217;m more tempted to perform this (equally pointless) activity. It&#8217;s more rewarding. It&#8217;s true that I could expect to become &#8216;better&#8217; at meditating in some sense, but practicing music offers definitive, and (I&#8217;m not sure how important this is) sharable improvements. <p></p> Of course, I&#8217;m not only picking a single most rewarding activity and sustaining it in every available moment (other than necessities like work/sleep/food/bills). My internal reward diminishes eventually, and during its refractory period, I&#8217;ll do the next thing. That implements a sort of preference for novelty and variety. Also, I have feelings of &#8216;needing to recharge facility X&#8217; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this as well now because I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;ll do something else until I go to sleep or nap, then I&#8217;ll get back to it when rested&#8221;. <p></p> That&#8217;s my explanation of why I don&#8217;t have a meditation habit, even though I never convinced myself that it would be a complete waste of time. <p></p> For sure I disagree with most things that come from a guru-driven (or worse, religion-driven) school, and that includes any sort of meditation instruction I&#8217;ve come across. I think it&#8217;s actually irresponsible to &#8220;try out&#8221; practices and beliefs too whole-heartedly. Once you endorse a set of practices at all, you enlist all your biases to cementing them in you. I do believe in avoiding unnecessary stress, and feeling like you need to continually monitor changes in yourself during such an experiment, in order to avoid passing a point of no return, doesn&#8217;t sound like fun. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m infinitely susceptible to influence, but I am definitely somewhat susceptible to both self-influence and peer pressure.

			&#8216;59 Seconds&#8217; Is a Good Self-help Book.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307474860/">59 Seconds</a> is full of evidence-based self-help advice. I recommend it (on the basis of the first 3 chapters - I haven&#8217;t finished). In some cases there may be a danger that findings of correlation lead to cargo-cult recommendations, but generally the causation of happiness and motivation is bidirectional (things that happen as a result of them also reinforce them). </p>
<p></p>  Some amusing studies cited in the book:
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;">The day before the 2004 American presidential election, more than a hundred voters were asked to imagine themselves going to the polling booth the following day. One group was told to carry out the visualization exercise from a first-person perspective (seeing the world through their own eyes), while another group was instructed to carry out the same task from a third-person perspective (seeing themselves as someone else would see them). Remarkably, 90 percent of those who imagined themselves from a third-person perspective went on to vote, compared with just more than 70 percent of those who employed first-person visualization. Although the explanation for the effect is uncertain, it could be that adopting a third-person perspective requires more mental effort than a first-person one and so results in more significant behavioral changes.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>A more powerful explanation: imagining people seeing you makes activates the idea that people will see you, which makes you behave more like you want to be seen - a &#8216;good citizen&#8217;. Just like making the lights less bright (via sunglasses, even) increases your cheating, because you&#8217;ll imagine that people can&#8217;t see you.</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; line-height: 14px; text-align: left;">People were taken to the bottom of a hill and asked to estimate how steep it was and therefore how difficult it would be to climb. When they were accompanied by a friend, their estimates were about 15 percent lower than when they were on their own, and even just thinking about a friend when looking at the hill made it seem far more surmountable.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, people don&#8217;t want to act weak in front of others. But I&#8217;ll definitely try thinking of my friends when I&#8217;m alone and facing a challenge.</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: lucida grande, tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; line-height: 14px; text-align: left;">They were asked to form a clear image in their mind’s eye and imagine how great it would feel to make a high grade. &#8230; Even though the daydreaming exercise lasted only a few minutes, it had a significant impact on the students’ behavior, causing them to study less and make lower grades on the exam.</span></span></blockquote>
<p><br> I&#8217;m now going to paraphrase most of the points in the first 3 chapters that I agree with. When I say &#8216;but &#8230;&#8217;, I mean that it&#8217;s something I &#8216;know&#8217; (have thought of, or read about elsewhere) that the book doesn&#8217;t mention.</p>
<p></p>  Positive thinking can lead to poor performance. Expecting a reward may also mean we&#8217;re less interested in the actual reward (we use up some of the juice in advance, and are less motivated by it).<p></p>  What&#8217;s recommended instead of pure daydreaming: imagine all the nice things that go with success, and all the problems likely to block you. Then, alternate through those lists (fantasizing about enjoying a benefit after reaching the goal, contemplating what response could be employed against the obstacle). The alternation sounds like a decent idea. In any case, the procedure helped on the whole. It can be helpful to actually form concepts for each thing, which is easier if you can assign a short label. Generally, writing seems to help with this. There&#8217;s a tendency for ideas mentally rehearsed to either get stuck or fade, which is avoided with diagrams or notes.<p></p> 
<h3>Diet tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>start eating at normal speed, then slow down+savor for the remainder</li>
<li>use tall glasses and small dishes/utensils</li>
<li>store snacks out of sight (where you&#8217;re not likely to remember them)</li>
<li>just eat. combining food with another engaging activity leads to a &#8216;popcorn movie&#8217; effect</li>
<li>keep track of what you eat (mental or brief written notes)</li>
<li>eat near a mirror. don&#8217;t exercise near one.</li>
<li>fidget more. move more vigorously in everyday life</li>
<li>don&#8217;t think eating &#8216;diet&#8217; foods will result in less caloric intake, or excuse you from activity</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Mood-boosting writing exercises</h3>
<p>You can send these to a friend you&#8217;re able to be honest with, or just write to yourself. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s diminishing returns on effort, length, and comprehensiveness. These worked for me (I did one a day). The effects lingered.</p>
<ul>
<li>things you&#8217;re currently grateful for</li>
<li>an emotional high point from your past</li>
<li>write about a fantasized-for future where you&#8217;re completely happy with what you&#8217;ve become and achieved</li>
<li>tell someone that they&#8217;re valuable to you (that you love them), and why.</li>
<li>some things that went better than expected for you in the last week (trivial things are fine), and why you think they happened</li>
</ul>
<p>Charitable giving makes people happy (or maybe the other way around?). The thrill is greatest if you get to see up close people&#8217;s lives improved by your giving (this is why professionals work in soup kitchens instead of more rationally working for extra money and paying others to work in the soup kitchen; this is also why charities that send you photos of the child you &#8216;sponsored&#8217; do repeat business). But I imagine you could derive a more abstract thrill from being the kind of person who maximizes the leverage of their charitable dollar in *really* helping people, not just in seeing grateful faces up close, knowing you&#8217;ve helped them.</p>
<p></p>  Also, it seems you should binge on &#8216;being a good person&#8217; satisfaction. Spreading out small kindnesses one a day for a week gave less joy to people than lumping them all into a single-day extravaganza (small things like writing thank-you notes, giving blood, etc.). I guess it has to be sufficient so you&#8217;re really convinced that you are a good person.<p></p>  Doing fun things with your money (vacation, food, shows, etc.) apparently makes you happier than buying super-expensive goods. (But I read elsewhere that people surveyed during a vacation are on average pretty stressed and unhappy; but it&#8217;s often a net gain because a few nice moments, blown up in stories/memories , that provide pleasant recollections and things to brag about over the coming years.) <p></p>  If you starve someone for validation, then it&#8217;s likely that they&#8217;ll spend more money on the strategy of happiness by consumption.<p></p>  Fake it until you make it, physically. Really smile, for a few seconds (at least 10). In order to do really do this, you should think of something that makes you smile. Similarly, sit up straight, don&#8217;t slouch. For men (or confident women?), stick your chest out. Take an expansive pose. Move and talk like a happy person - swing your arms more, bounce more when walking, be more expressive in nonverbal communication (nod your head when you follow what someone is saying, smile, etc), all your voice to swing to higher pitch and speak faster (like you&#8217;re excited), say emotionally positive things (express liking and approval), and shake hands firmly. Don&#8217;t use first person pronouns so much. (I&#8217;m not sure if all of these can be abused for reverse-expected causation like smiling can, but for sure they&#8217;re correlated with happiness).<p></p>  Active habits that increase happiness may increase it permanently, as opposed to accidental windfalls (lottery winning) which make you happy only for a little while.<p></p> 
<h3>Persuasion</h3>
<p>Small and random rewards work better than rewards large enough that people think they&#8217;re doing something just because they&#8217;re paid for it.</p>
<p></p>  If you want a job, make them like you in the interview. Good eye contact, smile, talk about other things. Act interested in their org and their work, and ask questions. Give a real compliment. Ask what they&#8217;re looking for in you. Act excited about the job. Open with confessions of weakness (provided your overall case is strong, people will like you more if you exhibit *some* weakness and are not all perfection; it also signals honesty) and close with your strongest bragging points (of course trying to pretend to modesty). The reverse order is worse. Remember always that there&#8217;s a chance others don&#8217;t notice your mistake (you certainly feel intensely ashamed of it, but remember that others don&#8217;t know and notice everything you do). It&#8217;s ok to acknowledge a mistake, and great to continue on as if you&#8217;re unperturbed.<p></p>  Sit toward the middle of a table (at least on &#8216;The Weakest Link&#8217;). Use simpler language (applies to invented product/company names, too - and probably to human names).<p></p>  Get people to do small favors that you act like you personally will greatly appreciate. This will make them see you as indebted to them, which is nice because they&#8217;re likely to keep investing in you.<p></p>  Familiarity breeds liking.<p></p>  Anything you can do that increases the tendency of people to like you is valuable.<p></p>  Carnegie: act interested in people. People love to feel like someone cares about them, and love to talk about themselves. Other tricks: match body language/speech, act modest, help people, give sincere compliments (all of this in a way that doesn&#8217;t make them suspicious that you&#8217;re trying to play them).<p></p>  If you gossip about someone&#8217;s negative behavior, people will unconsciously associate you with that behavior. (but in general gossip is widely used to enforce social norms; maybe not participating at all marks you as holier-than-thou or free-riding)<p></p>  If people think highly of you already, a mistake that you&#8217;d think would be embarrassing will endear you more to them. If they think you&#8217;re a loser, then they&#8217;ll really turn away in disgust after that same mistake.<p></p>  Get people to say something positive at all (&#8220;how are you feeling/doing?&#8221;), and then ask them to do something for you. This works better than just asking.<p></p>  People like things more if they&#8217;re paired with a (free?) meal or a drink. Caffeine makes you more persuadable (by new arguments, I imagine).<p></p>  &#8220;If the gloves don&#8217;t fit, you must acquit.&#8221; Rhyme is actually persuasive. (In general things that are easier to understand/remember are more persuasive; people distrust the same words said in a thick foreign accent, for that reason among others).<p></p>  If people think they&#8217;re more like you (e.g. same name), they&#8217;ll like you or help you more.<p></p>  Crack a joke that gets them to smile, and they&#8217;ll give you a better deal in negotiation.<p></p>  If you need help, target a specific person and ask them directly; don&#8217;t ask the group.<p></p>  People will reciprocate. Do them small favors (of course, this may make you like them more).<p></p>  Put a cute smiling baby photo in your wallet. Then it gets returned 1/3 the time instead of 1/8. (because they imagine they like you, and because babies are thrilling in a way other attractive things aren&#8217;t).<p></p> 
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<ol>
<li>make a plan (write down or form a mental list of subtasks)</li>
<li>tell people you&#8217;re working on the goal (this raises the stakes, at least, and the bigger a show you make, to more (important) people, about your promise to do something, the more worried you&#8217;d be at not doing it). </li>
<li>mentally link the steps of your plan with the good things you&#8217;ll get when you finish it - be attracted to what you&#8217;ll have when you succeed, not repulsed by what will happen if you fail. frequently remind yourself of the attraction</li>
<li>give yourself artificial rewards (as part of your plan or impromptu) for achieving subtasks, if they&#8217;re not inherently rewarding</li>
<li>journal or chart plan progress or actions taken</li>
<li>actually get started. once you do this, you&#8217;ll be nagging/worrying over it until you finish or give up. you&#8217;ll want to work on it more. this is where most procrastination lies: in not starting.</li>
</ol>
<p><br> Not very useful: worship and emulate people you admire for having done similar, think about the bad consequences of failure, consciously try to &#8216;not think of an elephant&#8217; (e.g. sex/drugs/food you want to cut back on), expect to exert willpower (perseverance in the face of high expected chance of unrewarding outcomes), fantasize about your future life after you&#8217;ve got what you want (this was actually recommended as a general mood booster, but I think it leeches away some of the inherent reward for achieving steps toward your goal).</p>
<p></p>  For each goal subtask, make yourself believe that you&#8217;ll probably succeed (come up with a good reason). Then outline the concrete actions you&#8217;ll take, and commit to a deadline and a reward that goes with that deadline (optional). List the benefits of winning the main goal (it&#8217;s also motivating to think of how you&#8217;ll be helping other people, not only yourself).<p></p>  I&#8217;ll probably continue as in this post later (for the remaining 7 chapters) as I read more.

Ordinarily when we watch the working of our mind/body complex, we tend to hide or ignore things which are not pleasant to us and to hold onto things which are pleasant. This is because our minds are generally influenced by our desires, resentment and delusion. Our ego, self or opinions get in our way and color our judgment.</span></p>

</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">When we mindfully watch our bodily sensations, we should not confuse them with mental formations, for bodily sensations can arise without anything to do with the mind. For instance, we sit comfortably. After a while, there can arise some uncomfortable feeling on our back or in our legs. Our mind immediately experiences that discomfort and forms numerous thoughts around the feeling. </span></p>

</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">At that point, without trying to confuse the feeling with the mental formations, we should isolate the feeling as feeling and watch it mindfully.

When we bundle our form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness up into one and try to watch all of them as feeling, we get confused, as we will not be able to see the source of feeling. If we simply dwell upon the feeling alone, ignoring other mental factors, our realization of truth becomes very difficult. </span></p>

Neither of them alone can do much for himself. But when the disabled person climbs on the shoulders of the blind man, together they can travel and achieve their goals easily. Similarly, the body alone can do nothing for itself. It is like a log unable to move or do anything by itself except to become a subject of impermanence, decay and death. The mind itself can do nothing without the support of the body. When we mindfully watch both body and mind, we can see how many wonderful things they do together.</span></p>

We have to be extremely wise and mindful to thank the person who explicates our faults so we will be able to tread the upward path toward improving ourselves. We all have blind spots. The other person is our mirror for us to see our faults with wisdom. We should consider the person who shows our shortcomings as one who excavates a hidden treasure in us that we were unaware of. It is by knowing the existence of our deficiencies that we can improve ourselves. Improving ourselves is the unswerving path to the perfection which is our goal in life.

<p><br> I just tried 10 minutes after reading this far. I ended my meditation 5 seconds before the timer rang (my brain knows what 10 minutes is?).</p>
<p></p>  I don&#8217;t avoid thoughts while meditating; I just try to not get emotionally agitated. Worries, plans, dissatisfactions, and concerns that came to mind had simple and easily reached explanations. My thoughts definitely don&#8217;t need fixing. When my temper/defensiveness is aroused, I definitely become combative and rash, but that doesn&#8217;t affect me normally, and I&#8217;m not so sure that it&#8217;s a terrible thing.<p></p>  I felt good. I adjusted my position until I was comfortable, then remained for about 9 minutes. I heard people talking nearby, but that doesn&#8217;t distract me. I&#8217;ll do it again. I like being awake and free of significant distractions, so my thoughts are slower and less reactive. I&#8217;ve meditated in yoga class, but that context is somewhat distracting (I&#8217;m excessively conscious of how my body feels, and the fact that I&#8217;m in a class).<p></p>  Aside from rest and quiet-thinking-time, I can see meditation as a possible emotional self-regulation practice - maybe similar to what you&#8217;d get by practicing controling some biofeedback indicator. I do feel something that could be described as being aware of different parts of my mind, especially the difference between what comes from my body&#8217;s senses and what comes (mostly) unprompted by them. I don&#8217;t feel any super bliss or &#8220;self is an illusion&#8221;.<p></p>  I don&#8217;t feel transformed. Just relaxed. If I were more tired, a 10 minutes nap would probably be more relaxing. But I have more specific and pleasant memories of a meditation experience than a nap (where I sometimes remember a few disjointed seconds of sleep-thought).<p></p>  Also, instead of paying attention to my breath as a fixed point as was recommended, I took something more abstract - my mortality. I think that&#8217;s the ultimate in true perspective.

</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">To prepare for this attainment, we should keep our mind in the present moment. The present moment is changing so fast that the casual observer does not seem to notice its existence at all. Every moment is a moment of events and no moment passes by without noticing events taking place in that moment. Therefore, the moment we try to pay bare attention to is the present moment. Our mind goes through a series of events like a series of pictures passing through a projector. Some of these pictures are coming from our past experiences and others are our imaginations of things that we plan to do in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">The mind can never be focused without a mental object. Therefore we must give our mind an object which is readily available every present moment. What is present every moment is our breath. The mind does not have to make a great effort to find the breath, for every moment the breath is flowing in and out through our nostrils. As our practice of insight meditation is taking place every waking moment, our mind finds it very easy to focus itself on the breath, for it is more conspicuous and constant than any other object.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the bliss, focus on how you feel. That seems to be their recipe. Definitely a potential feedback loop. I didn&#8217;t do this. I just paid attention to my thoughts/feelings and didn&#8217;t spend more than a moment thinking about the referent of any one thought. Mostly I just thought about the thought itself, how it made me feel, and why I was having it (in simple, broad terms).</p>
<p></p>  I&#8217;ll try this physical-present-focus-bliss recipe next time.<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">After sitting in the manner explained earlier and having shared your loving-kindness with everybody</span></span></blockquote>
<p>I assume this means to remember a generalized love for all the people you can love. I don&#8217;t think it was defined earlier.</p>

<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span>
</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">take three deep breaths. After taking three deep breaths, breathe normally, letting your breath flow in and out freely, effortlessly and begin focusing your attention on the rims of your nostrils. Simply notice the feeling of breath going in and out. When one inhalation is complete and before exhaling begins, there is a brief pause. Notice it and notice the beginning of exhaling. When the exhalation is complete, there is another brief pause before inhaling begins. Notice this brief pause, too. This means that there are two brief pauses of breath&#8211;one at the end of inhaling, and the other at the end of exhaling. The two pauses occur in such a brief moment you may not be aware of their occurrence. But when you are mindful, you can notice them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Do not verbalize or conceptualize anything. Simply notice the in-coming and out-going breath without saying, &#8220;I breathe in&#8221;, or &#8220;I breathe out.&#8221; When you focus your attention on the breath ignore any thought, memory, sound, smell, taste, etc., and focus your attention exclusively on the breath, nothing else.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>sound easy</p>

It may go to past experiences and suddenly you may find yourself remembering places you&#8217;ve visited, people you met, friends not seen for a long time, a book you read long ago, the taste of food you ate yesterday, and so on. As soon as you notice that you mind is no longer on your breath, mindfully bring it back to it and anchor it there.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t generally have this problem, except a few times a year when I&#8217;m insomniac.</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However, in a few moments you may be caught up again thinking how to pay your bills, to make a telephone call to you friend, write a letter to someone, do your laundry, buy your groceries, go to a party, plan your next vacation, and so forth.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>I do have such thoughts simmering below conscious notice (usually I&#8217;m too focused on my immediate task, but in meditating, they can pop up). It would be nice to temporarily disable them, as useful as they generally are.</p>

<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span> </span>As soon as you notice that your mind is not on your subject, bring it back mindfully. Following are some suggestions to help you gain the concentration necessary for the practice of mindfulness.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what the hurry is. I&#8217;d rather understand why my mind is on the subject, then return to neutral. After all, I want honesty, insight, and clear thinking.</p>

</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>1. Counting</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">In a situation like this, counting may help. The purpose of counting is simply to focus the mind on the breath. Once you mind is focused on the breath, give up counting. This is a device for gaining concentration. There are numerous ways of counting. Any counting should be done mentally.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span>
</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>2. Connecting</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">After inhaling do not wait to notice the brief pause before exhaling but connect the inhaling and exhaling, so you can notice both inhaling and exhaling as one continuous breath.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span>
</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>3. Fixing</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">After joining inhaling and exhaling, fix your mind on the point where you feel you inhaling and exhaling breath touching. Inhale and exhale as on single breath moving in and out touching or rubbing the rims of your nostrils.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>redundant w/ 2. of course you&#8217;re supposed to pay attention to how you feel in the moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span>
</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>4. Focus you mind like a carpenter</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">A carpenter draws a straight line on a board and that he wants to cut. Then he cuts the board with his handsaw along the straight line he drew. He does not look at the teeth of his saw as they move in and out of the board. Rather he focuses his entire attention on the line he drew so he can cut the board straight. Similarly keep your mind straight on the point where you feel the breath at the rims of your nostrils.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>redundant</p>

<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span>
</span></span><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong>5. Make you mind like a gate-keeper</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;">A gate-keeper does not take into account any detail of the people entering a house. All he does is notice people entering the house and leaving the house through the gate. Similarly, when you concentrate you should not take into account any detail of your experiences. Simply notice the feeling of your inhaling and exhaling breath as it goes in and out right at the rims of your nostrils.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>redundant</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As you continue your practice you mind and body becomes so light that you may feel as if you are floating in the air or on water. You may even feel that your body is springing up into the sky. When the grossness of your in-and-out breathing has ceased, subtle in-and-out breathing arises. This very subtle breath is your objective focus of the mind. This is the sign of concentration. This first appearance of a sign-object will be replaced by more and more subtle sign-object.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>I guess you probably can form several levels of concepts in your brain for the various subjective noticing-breathing colors</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">But the breath becomes subtler and subtler as the sign develops. Because of this subtlety, you may not notice the presence of your breath. Don&#8217;t get disappointed thinking that you lost your breath or that nothing is happening to your meditation practice. Don&#8217;t worry. Be mindful and determined to bring your feeling of breath back to the rims of your nostrils. </span></span></blockquote>
<p>I disagree. You should do nothing. Maybe his recommendation is more likely to bring you the physical bliss, but if you want insight, I don&#8217;t see why you should obsess over a fixed point.</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This is the time you should practice more vigorously, balancing your energy, faith, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>mumbo jumbo</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As you keep your mind focused on the rims of your nostrils, you will be able to notice the sign of the development of meditation. You will feel the pleasant sensation of sign. Different meditators feel this differently. It will be like a star, or a peg made of heartwood, or a long string, or a wreath of flowers, or a puff of smoke, or a cob-web, or a film of cloud, or a lotus flower, or the disc of the moon or the disc of the sun.</span></span></blockquote>
<p>Your spirit animal! I wonder how common such an association is, if not encouraged. Definitely I can close my eyes and at will recall visual imagery almost as in a dream.</p>
<blockquote><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Earlier in your practice you had inhaling and exhaling as objects of meditation. Now you have the sign as the third object of meditation. When you focus your mind on this third object, your mind reaches a stage of concentration sufficient for your practice of insight meditation. This sign is strongly present at the rims of the nostrils. Master it and gain full control of it so that whenever you want, it should be available. Unite the mind with this sign which is available in the present moment and let the mind flow with every succeeding moment. As you pay bare attention to it, you will see the sign itself is changing every moment.<span> <br> </span></span></span></blockquote>
<p>It seems like he wants me to allow visual imagery to happen, and to not fix it to a single form. Good, that would be boring and maybe dangerous, like monitor burn-in :-)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve tried meditation before, and will try it again, I recommend not reading &#8220;Mindfulness in Plain English&#8221;. It&#8217;s too much poor rhetoric, and doesn&#8217;t at all live up to its grand promises. I will say that imagining being part of some &#8220;set of other people who&#8217;ve lived through exactly this emotional experience&#8221; is more soothing than I expected, so I appreciate Mindfulness and other books for recommending it.</p>
<p>Gurus are mostly full of it. Don&#8217;t bother listening until you see evidence that they and their subjects are doing subtantially better than placebo. But if you like, go ahead and pick the placebo with the least costs. Maybe a life with no placebos at all is unnecessarily hard. After all, your skeptical purity is nothing to be proud of once you die (an inspiring example for others to live by? who cares - you&#8217;re dead).</p>
