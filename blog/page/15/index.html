<br> <strong><a href="http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/08/aje.kwr052.abstract" target="_blank" style="color: #2244bb;">Seasonal Variations in Sleep Problems at Latitude</a><span> </span>63°–65° in Norway The Nord-Trøndelag Health Study, 1995–1997</strong><span> </span><p></p>  Most studies on seasonal variability in sleep have asked participants if they think their sleep quality varies with the seasons, which reveals the research hypothesis to the participants. To date, the hypothesis of seasonal variation in sleep has not been tested in a large population-based fully blinded study. The aim of the current study was to investigate monthly variations in sleep problems in a geographic region of Norway with large seasonal differences in daytime light. Using data from a general health survey, the authors had access to information on sleep in the general population, collected across the seasons over 2 years without linking sleep to seasonal variation. In all, 43,045 participants (mean age, 44.6 years) of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study, 1995–1997 (referred to as “HUNT-2”), provided reports of insomnia symptoms and time in bed in all months except July. The mean prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 12.4%. No evidence of a seasonal variation on reports of insomnia symptoms or time in bed was found. These null findings are in marked contrast to previous seasonality studies of sleep. Previous studies reporting seasonal variations in sleep and insomnia might have been subject to publication biases and lack of blinding to the research hypothesis.</blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">SAD</a> doesn&#8217;t exist. But if you can&#8217;t find seasonal sleep variation in 40,000 people, it probably doesn&#8217;t exist. If prolonged sunlight during long extreme-north summer days makes it harder to sleep normally, then people must have adjusted (e.g. blinds that actually block the light).</p>

The research relates the concept of high mind development to the potential to become really good at something:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>New research shows that musicians’ brains are highly developed in a way that makes the musicians alert, interested in learning, disposed to see the whole picture, calm, and playful. The same traits have previously been found among world-class athletes, top-level managers, and individuals who practice transcendental meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using<span> </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography" target="_blank" style="color: #2244bb;">EEG</a>‘s to measure brain activity, researchers concluded the following about the brains of musicians:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>They have well-coordinated frontal lobes. Our frontal lobes are what we use for higher brain functions, such as planning and logical thinking. Another characteristic is that activity at a certain frequency, so-called alpha waves, dominates. Alpha waves occur when the brain puts together details into wholes. Yet another EEG measure shows that individuals with high mind brain development use their brain resources economically. They are alert and ready for action when it is functional to be so, but they are relaxed and adopt a wait-and-see attitude when that is functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Musicians also exhibited higher levels of moral reasoning and had more frequent “peak experiences”– intense moments of happiness and feelings of transcending limitations.</p>
</span></span>(via <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com">Frakonomics</a>)<p></p>  Probably the same can be found in anyone who tries hard to do well at a complex task e.g. acting or mathematics (which isn&#8217;t to say that certain facilities aren&#8217;t unique in music or sport or politicking, as opposed to purely intellectual pursuits).

Consider this question:</p>
<p>&#8220;What percentage of the world’s airports are in the USA?&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is to guess at the answer. Then take a minute, drink a soda or a cup of coffee, and make another guess. The claim is that the<span> </span><em>average</em><span> </span>of the two guesses is usually more accurate the original guess. They show by an empirical study that the increase in accuracy is about 6.5 percent. Waiting weeks ups the accuracy much more—the claim is it is now about 16 percent. Here is a chart from their paper:</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br> First, read the graph (bigger bar = more error). The second guess is worse than the first. But the average is better.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s well known that the average of several experts&#8217; estimates is more reliable than a randomly selected expert&#8217;s.<p></p>  I&#8217;m skeptical about the 3-week delay; if just a few subjects sought out information about the question on the web, then that could explain the difference. However, it makes sense that the first estimate probably anchors the second with immediate re-guessing. Probably the weeks-delayed re-guess is indeed superior even if the person isn&#8217;t exposed to new information in the interim.<p></p>  I&#8217;d like to compare the average of two quick guesses with one well-considered guess (similar energy expenditure).<p></p>  (via <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com">rjlipton</a>)<p></p>  p.s. don&#8217;t use bar graphs if the origin isn&#8217;t 0; it&#8217;s misleading

			Weight Gain After Liposuction</a>

<img alt="Kolata-articlelarge" src="/images/2011/05/02/weight-gain-after-liposuction/25604896-KOLATA-articleLarge.jpg">
</div>
<p></p>  This <a href="http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/oby201164a.pdf">new study</a> (via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/weekinreview/01kolata.html">NY Times</a>) shows that within a year of liposuction, women regained all the weight and fat cells, but distributed elsewhere, since liposuction destroys the substrate under the skin on which fat cells grow.<p></p>  Background knowledge: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte">fat cells</a> produce hormones that affect hunger and metabolism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistin">resisitin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin">adiponectin</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin">leptin</a>). A depleted fat cell &#8220;wants&#8221; to be filled. Excessively fat people often end up with diabetes and heart failure. They also really experience more physical hunger.<p></p>  I have 70% belief in the following: if you overfill your fat cells, then the total number of fat cells increases (more or less permanently; they are replaced one for one as they die off). If you boost your peak number of fat cells, you will always have that peak number when you lose weight; they&#8217;ll just be emptier and causing you more hunger.<p></p>  Tendencies to &#8220;put on weight&#8221; first in one location or another are at least partly due to the larger number of fat cells there.<p></p>  A new theory proposed by the study authors (I don&#8217;t believe the evidence proves it yet): the body has some homeostasis in terms of the number of fat cells - if you destroy fat cells, it will add more (other than you&#8217;d expect from overeating so that existing fat cells are full). If this is true, they should be able to find something produced by each fat cell that doesn&#8217;t depend on its fullness (as well as the mechanism regulating fat cells birth as a function of that signal). I think this because if the same intensity of hormonal signaling can be caused e.g. by 2 full fat cells as 1 empty one then the liposucked women would be able to avoid growth of new fat cells by leaving those cells empty (which would require a change in their diet). In other words, I&#8217;m not sure how the authors ruled out the obvious explanation that the previously fat women continued overeating after the liposuction.<p></p>  It is interesting at least, to know for sure that there&#8217;s not much obstacle to putting on a ton of fat anywhere and everywhere - that it&#8217;s probably not much harder to add 30lbs of fat to just the upper body (assuming full-lower-body-liposuction) than it is to add 30lbs distributed evenly (no liposuction).

But it sure is possible and fun to imagine. How many intelligent alien species are there, ever existing or now existing? Fun to consider, especially since the answer to both questions could possibly be zero, but not necessarily fewer than billions (even though we haven&#8217;t yet found a single one).
<p>Also, it&#8217;s hard to predict whether sending obvious signals of our existence and nature at lightspeed will yield good or bad results if and when we&#8217;re contacted by aliens. But I&#8217;m inclined to believe that, even though we don&#8217;t have the ability to hide completely, we should try to hide. This means at least making our wireless data signals look like constant noise (something that happens automatically if you&#8217;re trying to maximize signal bandwidth given limited EM spectrum). There&#8217;s definitely nothing wrong with listening in case any other species was so bold as to not hide.</p>

<p></p>  (LDL is the &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol)<p></p>  I&#8217;ve been increasing my butter intake (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/">because of supposed benefits on memory recall speed</a>) and I haven&#8217;t felt sluggish or unhealthy. After a few months, my overall cholesterol was slightly &#8220;high&#8221; but the &#8220;good&#8221; to &#8220;bad&#8221; ratio was very favorable. I haven&#8217;t managed close to half a stick (1/4 cup) daily; that&#8217;s a lot of work. It&#8217;s nice to imagine that something delicious might be good for you (thus the popularity of dark-chocolate-benefits research and the like).<p></p>  If you substitute lard or coconut oil instead of butter, which should be similarly high in saturated fat, the improvement vanishes. So it&#8217;s not just caused by increased fat or calories.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/">The Lives of Others</a> (2006) was more to me than just a story about the East German secret police. It&#8217;s better than any of the great movies released last year (King&#8217;s Speech, Animal Kingdom, Winter&#8217;s Bone, Black Swan). It also has one of my favorite movie sex scenes (&#8220;presumably, they have intercourse&#8221;).</p>
<p></p>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337057/">Rampage</a> (2009) was exuberant and creepy, but the directing was not, as many reviewers claimed, great, or even good. The final epilogue should definitely have been cut. End instead on Brendan Fletcher (who was awesome) talking to his parents instead. Also, I would not have played the bingo scene for laughs - too out of character.<p></p>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/">Never Let Me Go</a> was dull but not awful. I loved the book. The movie&#8217;s story would be a little muddled unless you&#8217;ve read the book. But if you&#8217;ve read the book, you don&#8217;t need the movie. The scenario makes little sense (also a problem with the book). I also didn&#8217;t understand why the movie captions gave years like 1980; it should be future-science-fiction, since it has human cloning.

			More Robin Hanson - on Hypocrisy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/two-faced-brains.html">Robin Hanson wonders</a> if our relatively independent are implicated in human hypocrisy:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Although human language allowed egalitarian rules whose uniform enforcement would have greatly reduced the advantages to big-brain conniving, humans had the biggest brains of all to unequally evade such rules. (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/evading-sharing-rules.html" style="color: #314c85;">more</a>)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">As with most lying or self-deception, homo hypocritus faces a serious implementation problem: how to keep the lies it tells separate from the “real” beliefs on which it acts. Since brains tend to be liberal with interconnections, there is a real risk of cross-talk between contradictory sets of opinions; lies may infect beliefs, and beliefs may infect lies.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">I’ve previously<span> </span><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/a-tale-of-two-tradeoffs.html" style="color: #314c85;">discussed</a><span> </span>one solution: have the different sets of opinions apply to different topics. For example, hold socially-acceptable opinions on far topics, where the personal consequences of actions tend to be smaller, and keep more realistic opinions on near topics, where such consequences tend to be larger. Yes there’s a risk others may notice that you change opinions without good reason as items move from near to far or far to near, but that may be a relatively small price to pay.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">A different solution is to have two distinct processing centers, each highly-connected internally, but with only modest between-center connections. One center would manage a coherent set of lies, while the other managed a coherent set of true beliefs. And in fact real brains have exactly this architecture! Left and right brains are highly connected internally, but only modestly connected to each other. Does the left brain manage a coherent set of overt opinions, while the right brain manages a coherent set of covert opinions?<span> </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function" style="color: #314c85;">Consider</a>:</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 40px; padding: 0px;">
<li>In all vertebrates left brains tend to control routine behavior (e.g. feeding) while right brains tend to respond to unusual events (e.g. fight/flight).</li>
<li>Left brains tend to initiate actions, via positive feelings, while right brains tend to inhibit actions, via negative feelings.</li>
<li>Compared to other primates, left vs. right human brains differ a lot<span> </span><a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/bk2/bk2ch1.htm" style="color: #314c85;">more</a> in function.</li>
<li>The left human brain manages language’s literal quotably-overt syntax, vocabulary, and semantics, while the right brain handles language’s less-socially-verifiable tone, accent, metaphor, allegory, and ambiguity.</li>
<li>Split brain patients show that left brains are adept at making up respectable explanations for arbitrary right brain behavior.</li>
<li>Right brains<span> </span><a href="http://akorra.com/2010/03/04/top-10-ways-to-tell-if-someone-is-lying/" style="color: #314c85;">tend to</a><span> </span>be used more in crafting lies, and they can <a href="http://www.singsurf.org/brain/rightbrain.php" style="color: #314c85;">read</a>subtle emotion clues better.</li>
<li>Left brain damage tends to distort behavior in more obvious and understandable ways.</li>
<li>Left brains emphasize decision-making, fact retrieval, numbers, and careful sequenced acts like<span> </span><a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/bk2/bk2ch1.htm" style="color: #314c85;">throwing</a>, while right brains emphasize art, music, spatial manipulation, and recognizing of shapes, patterns, and faces.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">It seems that in most animals, left brains tend to manage and initiate actions within the current mode, while right brains watch in the background for patterns and reasons to veto current actions and switch modes. In humans, it seems the current-action-sequencer brain half was recruited to focus more on managing overt rule-following language, decisions, and actions, ready to explain away any apparent rule-violations. The less-introspectively-accessible pattern-recognizing background-watcher brain half, in contrast, was apparently recruited to focus on harder-to-testify-on-and-so-more-easily-covert meaning, opinion, and communication, including art and music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes sense to me that the most effective politicians might be independently gauging and planning social moves, while the analytical/verbal part supplies at least competent pattern-matching impression of being fully engaged only in honest problem solving and assessment. That normal people don&#8217;t do this very well just means that modern life forgives a bit of laziness. Salesmen, politicians, church leaders, teachers, negotiators, even effective internet-daters &#8230; I&#8217;d expect all of those to have well-practiced parallel processing of social context alongside the content of the overt communication in that context. Maybe some people get by with carefully considered moves constructed offline, but that&#8217;s far less powerful than true extemporaneous ability.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s not terribly important whether some of this multitasking is left/right brain, but it would be nice to see physical confirmation (what&#8217;s going on in brain scans of effective vs. ineffective schmoozers at the same physical arousal/confidence level?).

<a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/04/earnings-effects-of-personality.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">The Effects of Education, Personality, and IQ on Earnings of High-Ability Men</a> </div> </blockquote> <blockquote> <div style="margin: 0px;">This paper estimates the internal rate of return (IRR) to education for men and women of the Terman sample, a 70-year long prospective cohort study of high-ability individuals. The Terman data is unique in that it not only provides full working-life earnings histories of the participants, but it also includes detailed profiles of each subject, including IQ and measures of latent personality traits. Having information on latent personality traits is significant as it allows us to measure the importance of personality on educational attainment and lifetime earnings.</div> </blockquote> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;"> <div style="margin: 0px;">
<br> Heckman explains:</div> <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">4.1 The Total Effect of Personality and IQ on Lifetime Earnings </blockquote> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">We begin by analyzing how personality and IQ influence lifetime earnings. We use the sum of each individual&#8217;s earnings from age 18 to age 75. &#8230; With this simple regression, Conscientiousness and Extraversion are positively associated with earnings, while Agreeableness and Openness are negatively associated with earnings (although Openness fails to be statistically significant in this very simple exercise). Our measure of Neuroticism does not have a clear association with earnings. It is remarkable that even in this very high-IQ sample, where the range of observed IQs is clearly restricted, IQ still has a positive and statistically highly significant association with lifetime earnings.</blockquote> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px;">This sounds about right from my long observations of highly successful entrepreneurs in a cognitively demanding field (market research): they were Intelligent (probably in the 125-160 range), Extraverted (good salesmen), Conscientious (i.e., hard-working), not too Neurotic (if they worried more about what could go wrong, they wouldn&#8217;t start companies), and not too Agreeable (they could kick ass when necessary, and were very competitive &#8211; raced yachts, drove imported Porsches that took six months to make street legal in the U.S.). They were probably more Open than average, although that has to do with them being entrepreneurs.</div> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px;">Heckman goes on. </div> </div> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Finally, note that even when controlling for rich background variable [such as education], IQ maintains a statistically significant effect on lifetime earnings. Even though the effect is slightly diminished from the uncontrolled association of the first column, it is still sizeable. Malcolm Gladwell claims rather generally in his book &#8220;Outliers&#8221; that for the Terman men, IQ did not matter once family background and other observable personal characteristics were taken into account. While we do not want to argue that IQ has a larger role for the difference between 50 and 100, for example, than for the difference between 150 and 200, we do want to point out that even at the high end of the ability distribution, IQ has meaningful consequences.</blockquote> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">In other words, people with 200 IQs will, on average, make more money than people with 150 IQs, all else being equal.<p></p>  For these very smart termites, getting more education increases lifetime income.</div> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">One caveat about causality is in order&#8230; We partially follow this approach by using early measures of Openness and Extraversion. However, the other personality traits are measured at a time where the men are already in their working lives. Thus, these measures are more relevant to the observed earnings, but at the same time we cannot exclude the possibility that, for example, a high score on Neuroticism is a result of one&#8217;s position in the workforce. </blockquote> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">In other words, Terman asked personality questions back in 1922 of the youths that map well onto today&#8217;s Big 5 personality traits of Openness and Extraversion, but the project didn&#8217;t get around for a decade or two to asking questions that map to the other three Big personality components: Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. For example, my dad spent 40 years as a stress engineer at Lockheed worrying about whether the wings would snap off planes. Did he get into that career to start with because he always was a worry wart, or is he a worry wart today because he spent 40 years worrying about how to keep planes from crashing?</div> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">You can read the whole study<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

But here I am doing academic research for not as much money as finance or silicon valley would provide &#8230; something is wrong. Either I love money, or I love academic research, or I&#8217;m happily lazy.

		      My favorite idea generator, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/evading-sharing-rules.html">Robin Hanson, says</a>:<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="color: rgb(53, 53, 55); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;"> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">I’ve argued that though humans language allowed egalitarian rules whose uniform enforcement would have greatly reduced the advantages to big-brain conniving, humans had the biggest brains of all to unequally evade such rules. Since rules to share food and other material goods are among the most important egalitarian rules, I find it fascinating to see the details of how modern foragers evade such rules:</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Below the melody line in praise of generosity … a grumbling about their stinginess, neglect, and ingratitude also was evident. Public pressure on individual Anbara to share was virtually irresistible, so various counterstrategies were adopted by the diligent to prevent exploitation by the lazy or manipulative. The most effective of these, in Hiatt’s view, was eating during food collection so that the greater part of a person’s produce was in an advanced state of digestion by the time he or she returned to camp. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Among adult men, demands for spears and other items of material culture were frequent, and two interesting strategies were used to avoid having to meet them. Valued spears or guns could be given to elderly women by their sons or other male relatives or purchased by such women with their pension checks, although the women never used the weapons for hunting. … It … allowed the person who was using the gun or spear, and who normally had it in their possession all the time, to refuse demands for it because it was not his to give. The other strategy relates most frequently to pipes and tobacco, but can be extended to almost anything. Old men, by carving sacred designs on their pipes and then covering them with strips of cloth or paperback, render them taboo to all women and any men who has not had the design revealed to him in a religious context. …</p>
<p></p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">When a child cries out for food from someone nearby, he or she will be given it; but then others nearby will in turn start asking the child for some of it, often taking it from the child’s hand, explaining their relationship as they take the food: “Oh, I’m your big sister/big brother; you’ve got to give food to me.” …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">[Sharing] demands can be refused. This can usually be done only by hiding, secretive behavior, and lying. … Such hiding is widespread and is a fully self-conscious strategy. … It is not only potential givers who hide resources, but also potential receivers, who hide what they have so that they may ask others because they are seen to have a need. Myers records how, after reacting angrily to a demand for cigarettes from a Pintupi man, he was surprised by the man not taking offense at his anger, but instead sympathizing with the fact that Myers had been taken advantage of. He told Myers that he should not give things away so easily and instructed him on how to hide a packet of cigarettes in his socks so that he could tell people he had none. Also, he gave Myers a packet of cigarettes and told him he had several others buried near his camp. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">This is, then, a society with collective appropriation of game, … true primitive communalism. Despite this communalism, evidence for the distribution of meat by age and sex … shows that distribution practices advantage senior men and disadvantage elderly women. … Formal [meat] sharing rules there allocate only about half the maximum number of basic cuts, leaving up to 50 percent by weight unallocated, and that where a capable hunter was not pulling his weight, meat was withheld from him, occasioning a dispute. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">“One of the least pleasing features of savage life is the quarrelling that results from dissatisfactions over food sharing”. … Over 60 percent of the topics in a sample of everyday !Kung conversations related to food and complaints about people’s generosity. Game sharing is nowhere near as rule-bound as many accounts suggest. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Myers recounts a case where the male leader … hid cooked meat in a flour drum on hearing of the arrival of his close and generous relatives from a nearby community. One of them came across and asked whether he had any meat, to which he replied that he was empty-handed. The visitor clearly did not believe him in light of the evidence of cooking strewn about, and he proceeded – without rancor – to open various flour drums lying around until he found the meat. … [This] did not lead to a repudiation of relatedness nor create conflict, because he had been generous enough in the past. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">The stresses of having too many social relationships to negotiate leads people to try to reduce demands by retreating into smaller groups, being passive in sharing, and keeping production to a minimum. … Interviewing informants about their practices … tends to put them on their best behavior and leads them to present a normative account. Such accounts are often neat and tidy and can mesh with romanticized views of other ways of life, thus reinforcing them, as in the case of game-sharing rules. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Demand sharing is a complex behavior that is not predicated simply on need. Depending on the particular social context, it may incorporate one, some, or all of the following elements. It may in part be a testing behavior to establish the state of a relationship in social systems where relationships have to be constantly produced and maintained by social action and cannot be taken for granted. It may in part be assertive behavior, coercing a person into making a response. It may in part be a substantiating behavior to make people recognize the demander’s rights. And, paradoxically, a demand in the context of an egalitarian society can also be a gift: it freely creates a status asymmetry, albeit of varying duration and significance.

<p>Fifteen healthy volunteers (who had never meditated) attended four 20-minute classes to learn a meditation technique known as “focused attention.” This is a form of mindfulness meditation where people are taught to attend to the breath and let go of distracting thoughts and emotions.</p>

<p>They actually caused people pain after the meditation (or non-meditation). Cool. </p>
<p></p>  Not that it makes any difference in the result, but I like when they can correlate brain scan differences with outcome differences:
<blockquote>

</span></span><p>meditation significantly reduced brain activity in the primary somatosensory cortex, an area that is crucially involved in creating the feeling of where and how intense a painful stimulus is.</p>
<p>The research also showed that meditation increased brain activity in areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and the orbito-frontal cortex, which shape how the brain builds an experience of pain from nerve signals from the body. The more these areas were activated by meditation, the more that pain was reduced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice what, if anything, they did to control for placebo effects. They should also test whether just breathing deeply, without any long meditation practice, explains some of the effect.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Via a popular article quoted by <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/news-you-can-use.html">Robin Hanson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Pooping on a modern sitting toilet is a big part of where hemorrhoids come from, and it can also cause diverticular disease … A 2003 study observed 28 people pooping in three positions: sitting on a high toilet, sitting on a lower one and squatting like they were catchers at a baseball game … Pooping took about a minute less when done squatting and that participants rated the experience as “easier”. In fact, toilets that require you to squat that way have been the standard for most of human history and are still widely used in the non-Western world. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(or you can just lean forward)</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Showering or bathing daily … wreaks havoc on something hilariously called the horny layer. Hot water, soap and abrasive surfaces strip off the horny layer, exposing living cells to the elements. … Damaging this protective layer of skin makes us more susceptible to disease. … Showering doesn’t kill bacteria or other microorganisms, though it does move them around. … For this reason, surgeons in many hospitals are not allowed to shower right before operating. … There are no measurable differences in the number of microorganism colonies a person is host to regardless of how frequently that person showers. … When you shower, use warm or cool water and a mild soap (if at all), and rehydrate the horny layer by rubbing on some moisturizer afterward. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, but people want to feel and smell clean. And cold showers eventually cause weight gain (probably fat) as you adapt. Also, the surgeons claim seems weak. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083541/">Shower followed by lotion is definitely better</a> than no shower, for surgeons. Also, what&#8217;s the increased infection rate given daily hot showers? If it&#8217;s small enough, then who cares?</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">The muscle you’re supposed to use to breathe, your diaphragm, is under your lungs and closer to your belly….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s possible to learn to take deeper, slower breaths when sedentary. That might be better (supposedly it decreased blood pressure). When exercising, it should come automatically. It would be good to see more evidence that people ever fail to use their diaphragm, given that breathing is unconscious. It would also be good to see if conscious exaggerated belly movements have a benefit for other reasons that increasing diaphragm-breathing.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Artificial light has pushed our normal bedtime back later and later, and this [natural] segmented sleep has been compressed into a single eight hours. … In a monthlong experiment, healthy subjects were given a long artificial “night” lasting 14 hours. They quickly reverted to the segmented pattern, waking up for an hour or two of “peaceful wakefulness” between two three to five hour stretches. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: don&#8217;t worry about it if you wake up and still feel tired. Go back to sleep.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Today, the majority of women in America are still directed to give birth in the “lithotomy” position, an odd pose that consists of lying flat on your back with your feet and legs raised, sometimes in stirrups. … This is pretty much the worst position imaginable to give birth in. … The World Health Organization has called use of the lithotomy position “clearly harmful,” and recommended that it be eliminated. …</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Flossing is much more important than brushing. … Brushing twice a day is generally still believed to be the best practice. But you should do it away from mealtimes to give your teeth time to recover from acid wear — ideally, right before you eat or drink anything. … You should use a soft brush and focus on your gums more than your actual teeth. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brush before meals if you have acid wear (grooves in enamel), otherwise it&#8217;s better to brush after. Without a test for acid wear, I can&#8217;t really act with much confidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">A study used an MRI to measure the spinal disk movement of three groups of people: one sitting, one slouching and one lying back at a 135-degree angle with their feet on the floor. The last group showed the least disk movement. By the way, this reclining position was common during the Roman Empire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Upright sitting (or slouching) is hard on the spine. Reclining is better. But if you&#8217;re using a computer screen, you&#8217;ll screw up your neck if you add unsupported reclining without changing your monitors.</p>

			David Foster Wallace on Empathy and Stranger-respect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      David Foster Wallace is a talented writer who killed himself.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">I just think to look across the room and automatically assume that somebody else is less aware than me, or that somehow their interior life is less rich, and complicated, and acutely perceived than mine, makes me not as good a writer. Because that means I&#8217;m going to be performing for a faceless audience, instead of trying to have a conversation with a person.</span></span></blockquote> He seems to have thought he could be happy if he were only less cynical.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">My natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it&#8217;s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.</span></span></blockquote> That&#8217;s human nature. We&#8217;re naturally geared to be effective, not happy. To really be empathetic requires either honest adherence to a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; belief system, or successful pleasure-guided experiments in perspective. <p></p>  It surely costs to empathize too much. And I&#8217;d rather keep my own identity than become part of a same-feeling mob. But empathy is a fantastic tool.<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">If you&#8217;re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won&#8217;t consider possibilities that aren&#8217;t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.<p></p>  Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that&#8217;s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you&#8217;re gonna try to see it.</span></span></blockquote> Whatever works. Of course there&#8217;s no literal mystical oneness, but if that&#8217;s how you describe your favorite feel-good perspective, I understand.
