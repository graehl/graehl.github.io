<p></p>  (LDL is the &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol)<p></p>  I&#8217;ve been increasing my butter intake (<a href="http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/01/29/the-buttermind-experiment/">because of supposed benefits on memory recall speed</a>) and I haven&#8217;t felt sluggish or unhealthy. After a few months, my overall cholesterol was slightly &#8220;high&#8221; but the &#8220;good&#8221; to &#8220;bad&#8221; ratio was very favorable. I haven&#8217;t managed close to half a stick (1/4 cup) daily; that&#8217;s a lot of work. It&#8217;s nice to imagine that something delicious might be good for you (thus the popularity of dark-chocolate-benefits research and the like).<p></p>  If you substitute lard or coconut oil instead of butter, which should be similarly high in saturated fat, the improvement vanishes. So it&#8217;s not just caused by increased fat or calories.

			Presumably, They Have Intercourse</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/">The Lives of Others</a> (2006) was more to me than just a story about the East German secret police. It&#8217;s better than any of the great movies released last year (King&#8217;s Speech, Animal Kingdom, Winter&#8217;s Bone, Black Swan). It also has one of my favorite movie sex scenes (&#8220;presumably, they have intercourse&#8221;).</p>
<p></p>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337057/">Rampage</a> (2009) was exuberant and creepy, but the directing was not, as many reviewers claimed, great, or even good. The final epilogue should definitely have been cut. End instead on Brendan Fletcher (who was awesome) talking to his parents instead. Also, I would not have played the bingo scene for laughs - too out of character.<p></p>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/">Never Let Me Go</a> was dull but not awful. I loved the book. The movie&#8217;s story would be a little muddled unless you&#8217;ve read the book. But if you&#8217;ve read the book, you don&#8217;t need the movie. The scenario makes little sense (also a problem with the book). I also didn&#8217;t understand why the movie captions gave years like 1980; it should be future-science-fiction, since it has human cloning.

			More Robin Hanson - on Hypocrisy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/two-faced-brains.html">Robin Hanson wonders</a> if our relatively independent are implicated in human hypocrisy:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Although human language allowed egalitarian rules whose uniform enforcement would have greatly reduced the advantages to big-brain conniving, humans had the biggest brains of all to unequally evade such rules. (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/evading-sharing-rules.html" style="color: #314c85;">more</a>)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">As with most lying or self-deception, homo hypocritus faces a serious implementation problem: how to keep the lies it tells separate from the “real” beliefs on which it acts. Since brains tend to be liberal with interconnections, there is a real risk of cross-talk between contradictory sets of opinions; lies may infect beliefs, and beliefs may infect lies.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">I’ve previously<span> </span><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/a-tale-of-two-tradeoffs.html" style="color: #314c85;">discussed</a><span> </span>one solution: have the different sets of opinions apply to different topics. For example, hold socially-acceptable opinions on far topics, where the personal consequences of actions tend to be smaller, and keep more realistic opinions on near topics, where such consequences tend to be larger. Yes there’s a risk others may notice that you change opinions without good reason as items move from near to far or far to near, but that may be a relatively small price to pay.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">A different solution is to have two distinct processing centers, each highly-connected internally, but with only modest between-center connections. One center would manage a coherent set of lies, while the other managed a coherent set of true beliefs. And in fact real brains have exactly this architecture! Left and right brains are highly connected internally, but only modestly connected to each other. Does the left brain manage a coherent set of overt opinions, while the right brain manages a coherent set of covert opinions?<span> </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function" style="color: #314c85;">Consider</a>:</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 40px; padding: 0px;">
<li>In all vertebrates left brains tend to control routine behavior (e.g. feeding) while right brains tend to respond to unusual events (e.g. fight/flight).</li>
<li>Left brains tend to initiate actions, via positive feelings, while right brains tend to inhibit actions, via negative feelings.</li>
<li>Compared to other primates, left vs. right human brains differ a lot<span> </span><a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/bk2/bk2ch1.htm" style="color: #314c85;">more</a> in function.</li>
<li>The left human brain manages language’s literal quotably-overt syntax, vocabulary, and semantics, while the right brain handles language’s less-socially-verifiable tone, accent, metaphor, allegory, and ambiguity.</li>
<li>Split brain patients show that left brains are adept at making up respectable explanations for arbitrary right brain behavior.</li>
<li>Right brains<span> </span><a href="http://akorra.com/2010/03/04/top-10-ways-to-tell-if-someone-is-lying/" style="color: #314c85;">tend to</a><span> </span>be used more in crafting lies, and they can <a href="http://www.singsurf.org/brain/rightbrain.php" style="color: #314c85;">read</a>subtle emotion clues better.</li>
<li>Left brain damage tends to distort behavior in more obvious and understandable ways.</li>
<li>Left brains emphasize decision-making, fact retrieval, numbers, and careful sequenced acts like<span> </span><a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/bk2/bk2ch1.htm" style="color: #314c85;">throwing</a>, while right brains emphasize art, music, spatial manipulation, and recognizing of shapes, patterns, and faces.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">It seems that in most animals, left brains tend to manage and initiate actions within the current mode, while right brains watch in the background for patterns and reasons to veto current actions and switch modes. In humans, it seems the current-action-sequencer brain half was recruited to focus more on managing overt rule-following language, decisions, and actions, ready to explain away any apparent rule-violations. The less-introspectively-accessible pattern-recognizing background-watcher brain half, in contrast, was apparently recruited to focus on harder-to-testify-on-and-so-more-easily-covert meaning, opinion, and communication, including art and music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes sense to me that the most effective politicians might be independently gauging and planning social moves, while the analytical/verbal part supplies at least competent pattern-matching impression of being fully engaged only in honest problem solving and assessment. That normal people don&#8217;t do this very well just means that modern life forgives a bit of laziness. Salesmen, politicians, church leaders, teachers, negotiators, even effective internet-daters &#8230; I&#8217;d expect all of those to have well-practiced parallel processing of social context alongside the content of the overt communication in that context. Maybe some people get by with carefully considered moves constructed offline, but that&#8217;s far less powerful than true extemporaneous ability.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s not terribly important whether some of this multitasking is left/right brain, but it would be nice to see physical confirmation (what&#8217;s going on in brain scans of effective vs. ineffective schmoozers at the same physical arousal/confidence level?).

<div style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;"> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">Steve Hsu has a fascinating <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/04/earnings-effects-of-personality.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">post </a>on a new paper by Nobel laureate economist/statistician James Heckman on the historic 1921 <a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2009/11/do-advanced-education-and-challenging.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">Terman Project</a> tracking more than 600 California white males with 135+ IQs over <a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2000/julaug/articles/terman.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">seven decades</a>.  You often hear about how this project shows that IQ doesn&#8217;t matter because, say, none of Terman&#8217;s Termites ever won the Nobel Prize.</div> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">Heckman writes:</div> <blockquote> <div style="margin: 0px;">
<a href="http://infoproc.blogspot.com/2011/04/earnings-effects-of-personality.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">The Effects of Education, Personality, and IQ on Earnings of High-Ability Men</a> </div> </blockquote> <blockquote> <div style="margin: 0px;">This paper estimates the internal rate of return (IRR) to education for men and women of the Terman sample, a 70-year long prospective cohort study of high-ability individuals. The Terman data is unique in that it not only provides full working-life earnings histories of the participants, but it also includes detailed profiles of each subject, including IQ and measures of latent personality traits. Having information on latent personality traits is significant as it allows us to measure the importance of personality on educational attainment and lifetime earnings.</div> </blockquote> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;"> <div style="margin: 0px;">
<br> Heckman explains:</div> <blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">4.1 The Total Effect of Personality and IQ on Lifetime Earnings </blockquote> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">We begin by analyzing how personality and IQ influence lifetime earnings. We use the sum of each individual&#8217;s earnings from age 18 to age 75. &#8230; With this simple regression, Conscientiousness and Extraversion are positively associated with earnings, while Agreeableness and Openness are negatively associated with earnings (although Openness fails to be statistically significant in this very simple exercise). Our measure of Neuroticism does not have a clear association with earnings. It is remarkable that even in this very high-IQ sample, where the range of observed IQs is clearly restricted, IQ still has a positive and statistically highly significant association with lifetime earnings.</blockquote> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px;">This sounds about right from my long observations of highly successful entrepreneurs in a cognitively demanding field (market research): they were Intelligent (probably in the 125-160 range), Extraverted (good salesmen), Conscientious (i.e., hard-working), not too Neurotic (if they worried more about what could go wrong, they wouldn&#8217;t start companies), and not too Agreeable (they could kick ass when necessary, and were very competitive &#8211; raced yachts, drove imported Porsches that took six months to make street legal in the U.S.). They were probably more Open than average, although that has to do with them being entrepreneurs.</div> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px;">Heckman goes on. </div> </div> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Finally, note that even when controlling for rich background variable [such as education], IQ maintains a statistically significant effect on lifetime earnings. Even though the effect is slightly diminished from the uncontrolled association of the first column, it is still sizeable. Malcolm Gladwell claims rather generally in his book &#8220;Outliers&#8221; that for the Terman men, IQ did not matter once family background and other observable personal characteristics were taken into account. While we do not want to argue that IQ has a larger role for the difference between 50 and 100, for example, than for the difference between 150 and 200, we do want to point out that even at the high end of the ability distribution, IQ has meaningful consequences.</blockquote> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">In other words, people with 200 IQs will, on average, make more money than people with 150 IQs, all else being equal.<p></p>  For these very smart termites, getting more education increases lifetime income.</div> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">One caveat about causality is in order&#8230; We partially follow this approach by using early measures of Openness and Extraversion. However, the other personality traits are measured at a time where the men are already in their working lives. Thus, these measures are more relevant to the observed earnings, but at the same time we cannot exclude the possibility that, for example, a high score on Neuroticism is a result of one&#8217;s position in the workforce. </blockquote> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">In other words, Terman asked personality questions back in 1922 of the youths that map well onto today&#8217;s Big 5 personality traits of Openness and Extraversion, but the project didn&#8217;t get around for a decade or two to asking questions that map to the other three Big personality components: Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. For example, my dad spent 40 years as a stress engineer at Lockheed worrying about whether the wings would snap off planes. Did he get into that career to start with because he always was a worry wart, or is he a worry wart today because he spent 40 years worrying about how to keep planes from crashing?</div> <p></p> <div style="margin: 0px; text-align: left;">You can read the whole study<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</div>
<a href="http://www.iza.org/conference_files/CoNoCoSk2011/gensowski_m6556.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">here</a>.</div> </div></blockquote> I always thought that I&#8217;d make more money by skipping grad school. But here I am doing academic research for not as much money as finance or silicon valley would provide &#8230; something is wrong. Either I love money, or I love academic research, or I&#8217;m happily lazy.

		      My favorite idea generator, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/evading-sharing-rules.html">Robin Hanson, says</a>:<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="color: rgb(53, 53, 55); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;"> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px;">I’ve argued that though humans language allowed egalitarian rules whose uniform enforcement would have greatly reduced the advantages to big-brain conniving, humans had the biggest brains of all to unequally evade such rules. Since rules to share food and other material goods are among the most important egalitarian rules, I find it fascinating to see the details of how modern foragers evade such rules:</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Below the melody line in praise of generosity … a grumbling about their stinginess, neglect, and ingratitude also was evident. Public pressure on individual Anbara to share was virtually irresistible, so various counterstrategies were adopted by the diligent to prevent exploitation by the lazy or manipulative. The most effective of these, in Hiatt’s view, was eating during food collection so that the greater part of a person’s produce was in an advanced state of digestion by the time he or she returned to camp. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Among adult men, demands for spears and other items of material culture were frequent, and two interesting strategies were used to avoid having to meet them. Valued spears or guns could be given to elderly women by their sons or other male relatives or purchased by such women with their pension checks, although the women never used the weapons for hunting. … It … allowed the person who was using the gun or spear, and who normally had it in their possession all the time, to refuse demands for it because it was not his to give. The other strategy relates most frequently to pipes and tobacco, but can be extended to almost anything. Old men, by carving sacred designs on their pipes and then covering them with strips of cloth or paperback, render them taboo to all women and any men who has not had the design revealed to him in a religious context. …</p>
<p></p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">When a child cries out for food from someone nearby, he or she will be given it; but then others nearby will in turn start asking the child for some of it, often taking it from the child’s hand, explaining their relationship as they take the food: “Oh, I’m your big sister/big brother; you’ve got to give food to me.” …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">[Sharing] demands can be refused. This can usually be done only by hiding, secretive behavior, and lying. … Such hiding is widespread and is a fully self-conscious strategy. … It is not only potential givers who hide resources, but also potential receivers, who hide what they have so that they may ask others because they are seen to have a need. Myers records how, after reacting angrily to a demand for cigarettes from a Pintupi man, he was surprised by the man not taking offense at his anger, but instead sympathizing with the fact that Myers had been taken advantage of. He told Myers that he should not give things away so easily and instructed him on how to hide a packet of cigarettes in his socks so that he could tell people he had none. Also, he gave Myers a packet of cigarettes and told him he had several others buried near his camp. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">This is, then, a society with collective appropriation of game, … true primitive communalism. Despite this communalism, evidence for the distribution of meat by age and sex … shows that distribution practices advantage senior men and disadvantage elderly women. … Formal [meat] sharing rules there allocate only about half the maximum number of basic cuts, leaving up to 50 percent by weight unallocated, and that where a capable hunter was not pulling his weight, meat was withheld from him, occasioning a dispute. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">“One of the least pleasing features of savage life is the quarrelling that results from dissatisfactions over food sharing”. … Over 60 percent of the topics in a sample of everyday !Kung conversations related to food and complaints about people’s generosity. Game sharing is nowhere near as rule-bound as many accounts suggest. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Myers recounts a case where the male leader … hid cooked meat in a flour drum on hearing of the arrival of his close and generous relatives from a nearby community. One of them came across and asked whether he had any meat, to which he replied that he was empty-handed. The visitor clearly did not believe him in light of the evidence of cooking strewn about, and he proceeded – without rancor – to open various flour drums lying around until he found the meat. … [This] did not lead to a repudiation of relatedness nor create conflict, because he had been generous enough in the past. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">The stresses of having too many social relationships to negotiate leads people to try to reduce demands by retreating into smaller groups, being passive in sharing, and keeping production to a minimum. … Interviewing informants about their practices … tends to put them on their best behavior and leads them to present a normative account. Such accounts are often neat and tidy and can mesh with romanticized views of other ways of life, thus reinforcing them, as in the case of game-sharing rules. …</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Demand sharing is a complex behavior that is not predicated simply on need. Depending on the particular social context, it may incorporate one, some, or all of the following elements. It may in part be a testing behavior to establish the state of a relationship in social systems where relationships have to be constantly produced and maintained by social action and cannot be taken for granted. It may in part be assertive behavior, coercing a person into making a response. It may in part be a substantiating behavior to make people recognize the demander’s rights. And, paradoxically, a demand in the context of an egalitarian society can also be a gift: it freely creates a status asymmetry, albeit of varying duration and significance.

<p></p>  Not that it makes any difference in the result, but I like when they can correlate brain scan differences with outcome differences:

</span></span><p>meditation significantly reduced brain activity in the primary somatosensory cortex, an area that is crucially involved in creating the feeling of where and how intense a painful stimulus is.</p>
<p>The research also showed that meditation increased brain activity in areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and the orbito-frontal cortex, which shape how the brain builds an experience of pain from nerve signals from the body. The more these areas were activated by meditation, the more that pain was reduced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice what, if anything, they did to control for placebo effects. They should also test whether just breathing deeply, without any long meditation practice, explains some of the effect.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Via a popular article quoted by <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/news-you-can-use.html">Robin Hanson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Pooping on a modern sitting toilet is a big part of where hemorrhoids come from, and it can also cause diverticular disease … A 2003 study observed 28 people pooping in three positions: sitting on a high toilet, sitting on a lower one and squatting like they were catchers at a baseball game … Pooping took about a minute less when done squatting and that participants rated the experience as “easier”. In fact, toilets that require you to squat that way have been the standard for most of human history and are still widely used in the non-Western world. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(or you can just lean forward)</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Showering or bathing daily … wreaks havoc on something hilariously called the horny layer. Hot water, soap and abrasive surfaces strip off the horny layer, exposing living cells to the elements. … Damaging this protective layer of skin makes us more susceptible to disease. … Showering doesn’t kill bacteria or other microorganisms, though it does move them around. … For this reason, surgeons in many hospitals are not allowed to shower right before operating. … There are no measurable differences in the number of microorganism colonies a person is host to regardless of how frequently that person showers. … When you shower, use warm or cool water and a mild soap (if at all), and rehydrate the horny layer by rubbing on some moisturizer afterward. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, but people want to feel and smell clean. And cold showers eventually cause weight gain (probably fat) as you adapt. Also, the surgeons claim seems weak. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083541/">Shower followed by lotion is definitely better</a> than no shower, for surgeons. Also, what&#8217;s the increased infection rate given daily hot showers? If it&#8217;s small enough, then who cares?</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">The muscle you’re supposed to use to breathe, your diaphragm, is under your lungs and closer to your belly….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s possible to learn to take deeper, slower breaths when sedentary. That might be better (supposedly it decreased blood pressure). When exercising, it should come automatically. It would be good to see more evidence that people ever fail to use their diaphragm, given that breathing is unconscious. It would also be good to see if conscious exaggerated belly movements have a benefit for other reasons that increasing diaphragm-breathing.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Artificial light has pushed our normal bedtime back later and later, and this [natural] segmented sleep has been compressed into a single eight hours. … In a monthlong experiment, healthy subjects were given a long artificial “night” lasting 14 hours. They quickly reverted to the segmented pattern, waking up for an hour or two of “peaceful wakefulness” between two three to five hour stretches. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: don&#8217;t worry about it if you wake up and still feel tired. Go back to sleep.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Today, the majority of women in America are still directed to give birth in the “lithotomy” position, an odd pose that consists of lying flat on your back with your feet and legs raised, sometimes in stirrups. … This is pretty much the worst position imaginable to give birth in. … The World Health Organization has called use of the lithotomy position “clearly harmful,” and recommended that it be eliminated. …</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">Flossing is much more important than brushing. … Brushing twice a day is generally still believed to be the best practice. But you should do it away from mealtimes to give your teeth time to recover from acid wear — ideally, right before you eat or drink anything. … You should use a soft brush and focus on your gums more than your actual teeth. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brush before meals if you have acid wear (grooves in enamel), otherwise it&#8217;s better to brush after. Without a test for acid wear, I can&#8217;t really act with much confidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #353537; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">
</span></span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 30px;">A study used an MRI to measure the spinal disk movement of three groups of people: one sitting, one slouching and one lying back at a 135-degree angle with their feet on the floor. The last group showed the least disk movement. By the way, this reclining position was common during the Roman Empire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right. Upright sitting (or slouching) is hard on the spine. Reclining is better. But if you&#8217;re using a computer screen, you&#8217;ll screw up your neck if you add unsupported reclining without changing your monitors.</p>

			David Foster Wallace on Empathy and Stranger-respect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      David Foster Wallace is a talented writer who killed himself.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">I just think to look across the room and automatically assume that somebody else is less aware than me, or that somehow their interior life is less rich, and complicated, and acutely perceived than mine, makes me not as good a writer. Because that means I&#8217;m going to be performing for a faceless audience, instead of trying to have a conversation with a person.</span></span></blockquote> He seems to have thought he could be happy if he were only less cynical.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">My natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me. About MY hungriness and MY fatigue and MY desire to just get home, and it&#8217;s going to seem for all the world like everybody else is just in my way. And who are all these people in my way? And look at how repulsive most of them are, and how stupid and cow-like and dead-eyed and nonhuman they seem in the checkout line, or at how annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line. And look at how deeply and personally unfair this is.</span></span></blockquote> That&#8217;s human nature. We&#8217;re naturally geared to be effective, not happy. To really be empathetic requires either honest adherence to a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; belief system, or successful pleasure-guided experiments in perspective. <p></p>  It surely costs to empathize too much. And I&#8217;d rather keep my own identity than become part of a same-feeling mob. But empathy is a fantastic tool.<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">If you&#8217;re automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won&#8217;t consider possibilities that aren&#8217;t annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.<p></p>  Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true. The only thing that&#8217;s capital-T True is that you get to decide how you&#8217;re gonna try to see it.</span></span></blockquote> Whatever works. Of course there&#8217;s no literal mystical oneness, but if that&#8217;s how you describe your favorite feel-good perspective, I understand.

Since start times may be correlated with other determinants of test scores, I also estimate the effect using only variation in start times within schools over time and ﬁnd a two percentile point improvement. The effect of start times on academic performance is robust to different speciﬁcations and sources of variation. The magnitude of the effect is similar to the difference in test scores for one additional year of parental education.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The impact of later start times on test scores is persistent. Conditional on a high school ﬁxed effect, a one hour later start time in grade eight is associated with an increase in test scores in grade ten similar in magnitude to the increase in grade eight. … The impact of start times is greatest in grade eight (who are more likely to have begun puberty than those in the sixth or seventh grade</p> </div></div></blockquote> With a later school start time, kids will sleep later and better. This is crucial at the onset of puberty. The size of the effect is about 2% (on test scores). It carries forward to later years. It&#8217;s unclear how much this harm (which persists years later) is in merely lost learning (that could be made up) as opposed to lasting physical damage.<p></p>  I was definitely permanently harmed by waking at 5:30am for over a year, to attend daily Mormon bible study (it&#8217;s supposed to run through all of high school, to protect us from the bad influences of less-conservative non-Mormon high school peers). I quit the church for other reasons, but in retrospect wish I had quit seminary immediately. I was 11-12 years old at the time and not close to fully grown. Sure, I would sometimes manage to sleep before 11pm, but others aren&#8217;t asleep by then, which makes it difficult, and even if they are, I often wanted to do my solitary things more than I wanted to sleep (not looking forward to the next morning, and wanting to prolong the sweet freedom of being awake).

			Earth: Not as Round as I Thought.</a>

<p></p>  Apparently that&#8217;s what the earth&#8217;s surface would look like if there were no tides or currents. Not as spherical as I thought. Naturally we should expect a bulge toward the equator since the Earth rotates, but there&#8217;s not as much radial symmetry as I&#8217;d imagined. <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/earths-gravity-revealed-in-unprecedented-detail">Source</a><p></p>  I was a little shocked at how non-ellipsoid the geoid is, so I finally looked it up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid">on Wikipedia</a>:
<blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 19px; font-family: sans-serif;">the geoid is by definition a surface to which the force of gravity is everywhere perpendicular</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="line-height: 19px; font-family: sans-serif;">Pretty straightforward. The point about how the ocean would be if there were no currents is more or less irrelevant. I guess any small change in the surface of the Earth wouldn&#8217;t greatly affect the plumb line. It&#8217;s also possible that the geoid surface will submerge below actual continents or even ocean floor - the plumb line dictates it. That dented upper left portion in the image must feel like a local hill, gravitationally, when you go over it - that is, I don&#8217;t think you can take any image of Earth from space, that has this apparent dented shape (and it&#8217;s not just the ocean and atmosphere rounding things out).</span></p>

			Our Especially Life-friendly Planet Means We Should Be Less Surprised by the Lack of Alien Visitors and More Optimistic About Avoiding Self-caused Apocalpyse</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      How many alien planets have intelligent life now? How many have ever had it? How long does an intelligent species usually survive? How cheap can interstellar travel become, and how hard is it to make the necessary discoveries?<p></p>  These are all interesting questions that are somewhat constrained by our observations: in the last 50 or so years we&#8217;ve been watching, we&#8217;ve seen no evidence of lightspeed messages, and, crackpot stories aside, no alien or alien-device visitors. It can&#8217;t be the case that intelligent species arise from nearly every one of billions of stars in our galaxy, that last a long time, and discover effective interstellar travel, or we&#8217;d have been colonized or visited already (surely not all of them would be cautiously isolationist). The argument that we haven&#8217;t recognized any signals isn&#8217;t too convincing to me, because efficient use of limited spectrum means that the signal should look like random noise (excessive regularities indicate a wasteful encoding).<p></p>  I mention this to introduce a cool synthetic (computer model only) experiment that suggests that our planet is extremely fortunately stable in its climate, which of course encourages (like in rainforests) diverse and interdependent species. It&#8217;s not a stretch to think that after a radical environmental change, humans would be extinct, but some simpler forms would survive. Of course, we shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find that we live in precisely the type of environment that makes intelligent life more likely than usual. In fact, any seemingly-odd coincidence (e.g. that we have a tide-locked moon orbiting us that shows the same hemisphere, give or take, at all times), may be well explained by such an effect (of course, truly meaningless coincidences are possible too).<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(53, 53, 55); font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">Three separate tests are investigated: (1) Earth-Moon properties and their effect on obliquity; (2) Individual planet locations and their effect on eccentricity variation; (3) The overall structure of the Solar System and its effect on eccentricity variation. In all three cases, the actual Earth/Solar System has unusually low [large-scale astronomically-caused climate change] frequencies compared to similar alternative systems. All three results are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% or better level, and the probability of all three occurring by chance is less than 10^-5</span></span></blockquote> - <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2010.0475">Testing Anthropic Selection: A Climate Change Example</a><p></p>  1 in 10000 isn&#8217;t THAT amazing, but it is cool. This doesn&#8217;t mean the odds of life in an earth-like planet are 1 in 10000; far from it. It means that we should expect to find similarly stable long-term climate conditions 1 in 10000 times. Also, don&#8217;t forget that this is *given* an earth-like planet (we don&#8217;t know how exactly how frequent those are in our galaxy etc. - yet).<p></p>  found via <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/04/planetary-filter-found.html">Robin Hanson</a> - the comments so far there don&#8217;t really discuss the post; people are just using it as a forum to share their pet views on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">anthropics</a><p></p>  On learning that our solar system is unusually well-suited to developing intelligent life, we should feel less worried about the likelihood of intelligent civilizations failing before they can broadcast for long, or develop interstellar travel+colonization, as suggested by the low apparent frequency of alien visits to us. The less likely intelligent life is to arise, the happier we should be. Advanced aliens are scary. Unlike the movies, we won&#8217;t win. I&#8217;d hope they are merciful, and able to trust us or contain us without destroying us.<p></p>  Of course, in some sense &#8220;less worried&#8221; is meaningless. If there&#8217;s not much you can do about a worry, hopefully you weren&#8217;t dwelling on it. Most of us probably don&#8217;t have the right estimate (and estimate of uncertainty of that estimate) of the likelihood of our civilization imploding, or aliens invading, before we learned of this evidence; if your estimates were vague enough to begin with, then you still won&#8217;t have a sharp belief even after many such pieces of suggestive anthropic evidence.

As a result, they avoid situations that further arouse their stimulated brains and are most comfortable when they are engaged in quiet, predictable activities. The exact opposite is true of those who score high on extroversion. Their brains have a much lower pre-set level of arousal, so they have a need for continuous stimulation. Because of this, they enjoy being with other people, risk taking, and impulsive behavior.</span></span></blockquote> &#8220;as a result&#8221; - questionable. But, cool correlation.<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 27px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 23px;">levels of openness are determined, at least to some extent, by birth order.<a href="http://bookworm.oreilly.com/view/59+Seconds/267455/OEBPS/Wise_9780307593269_epub_nts_r1.htm#c10-fn005" class="hlink" style="color: rgb(46, 69, 96) ! important; text-decoration: none;"><sup class="frac" style="vertical-align: 4px; font-size: 0.7em;">5</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>According to Sulloway’s theory, because younger children haven’t developed the abilities and skills that their older siblings have, they explore novel ways to get their parents’ love and attention, and this, in turn, causes them to develop into more open, creative, unconventional, adventurous, and rebellious people.</span></span></blockquote> He studied biographies of famous people to &#8220;prove&#8221; his idea - confirmation bias abounds.

Now repeat exactly the same procedure for your right third finger. </span></span></blockquote> (ring finger)<p></p>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio">Wikipedia</a> has a picture that&#8217;s be more instructive than the text above.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 17px;">To find the 2D:4D ratio, divide the length of your first finger by the length of your third finger. Research shows that the average male ratio is about .98, and a ratio of about .94 would be regarded as especially masculine, while a ratio of 1.00 would be viewed as more feminine. For women, the average ratio is about 1.00, and a score of about .98 would be regarded as more masculine &#8230;<br> </span></span></blockquote> I had a ratio of .94 in each hand; a female friend had a ratio of 1.02 in her left hand and 0.98 in her right. Different ratios across hands is relatively unusual, but it&#8217;s characteristic of (a small sample of) famous comedians (although the trend is in the direction of a larger ratio for the right hand, not the left).<p></p>  People describe their pets as having similar personalities to themselves. On average, people who owned fish self-described as happiest, dog owners as the most fun to be with (obviously they experience the joy of using their dog as an attention magic in public), cat owners as the most dependable and emotionally sensitive (most cat owners are female?), and reptile owners the most independent (?).<p></p>  People with bumper stickers are aggressive tailgaters and likely road ragers.<p></p>  If you lace your fingers together then put one thumb over the other, if your dominant hand&#8217;s thumb goes on top, you&#8217;re probably left-brain (verbal/analytical) dominant. (I normally am, although I happened to have the other thumb on top at the time I read this).<p></p>  &#8220;Evening people&#8221; are more extroverted, noncomforming, intuitive, and impulsive. &#8220;Morning people&#8221; are more introverted, self-controlled, and eager to please. (as self-identified by when you say you feel best sleeping/waking with no external constraints). I think there are all sorts of confounds (what are you really learning when someone says they would choose to be a morning person? probably that they got used to waking up early for a 8:30-5:30pm job, which tells you a lot about them). In other words, the problems with these questionnaire studies is that you&#8217;re learning something about their life, but not necessarily anything fundamental (if their circumstances change, but their fundamental personality doesn&#8217;t, their answers will probably change a bit).<p></p>  <h3>Recap of key advice:<br> </h3> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

This, in turn, can cause them to be more optimistic about the future and can improve their physical health.</p> </div></div></blockquote> This worked for me.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

Those who give a few dollars to the needy, buy a small surprise gift for a loved one, donate blood, or help a friend are inclined to experience a fast-acting and significant boost in happiness.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Acting in a way where you feel like you&#8217;re taking care of people is rewarding.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

The plants help reduce stress and induce good moods, which, in turn, promote creativity.</p> </div></div></blockquote> I&#8217;ve had a plant for ages.

In one dating study, the touch produced a 20 percent increase in the number of people who accepted an invitation to dance in a nightclub and a 10 percent increase in those who would give their telephone number to a stranger on the street.</p> </div></div></blockquote> I feel good when I do this.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

Such “expressive writing” results in partners’ using more positive language when they speak to each other, leading to a healthier and happier relationship</p> </div></div></blockquote> If you commit any feelings or thoughts to paper it solidifies them in some way (&#8220;I&#8217;m the person who said they feel X&#8221; will make me feel X more.

In addition, people are about 20 percent less likely to lie in an e-mail than in a telephone call, because their words are on record and so are more likely to come back and haunt them.</p> </div></div></blockquote> Some people are excellent liars and are quite specific, fast-talking, and confident. I guess this is good for detecting mostly-honest people making an uncharacteristic fib. But I like the tip about email for suspected expert liars.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

You must have tried very hard”) encourages them to try regardless of the consequences, therefore sidestepping fear of failure. This, in turn, makes them especially likely to attempt challenging problems, find these problems enjoyable, and try to solve them on their own time.</p> </div></div></blockquote> I didn&#8217;t read this chapter (I don&#8217;t plan on being a parent any time soon), but that seems smart.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;">

</div>a reality. One especially effective technique involves adopting a third-person perspective: those who visualize themselves as others see them are about 20 percent more successful than those who adopt a first-person point of view. </div></blockquote> Cool. I forgot to try this. My dad says he likes to think of himself as he&#8217;s being perceived (physically) when he interacts with people. That&#8217;s a special and unusual type of multitasking. Perhaps becoming comfortable with that leads to more confidence. I don&#8217;t know whether this really helps with long term goals, but I guess this advice is backed by (sloppy and then loosely interpreted) actual studies.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Charis,Times New Roman,Verdana,Arial; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"> <h3 class="section" style="color: rgb(159, 109, 69); text-align: center; font-size: medium; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 2em;">

I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s what I want to optimize for, but I&#8217;ll keep it in mind if I can&#8217;t otherwise decide.<p></p>  This reminds me of people reporting that they took some big risk, starting a company, because someone advised them &#8220;20 years from now will you look back and regret not taking that risk?&#8221; - but consider the downside: &#8220;20 years from now will you look back and wonder what you missed out on because you made that risky choice that ended up really costing you?&#8221;.

			Self Control Pisses Me Off?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; font-size: small;"> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">A brand new paper, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, extends this link between self-control and anger, even as it complicates the ego-depletion model. In a series of clever studies, the Northwestern psychologists David Gal and Wendy Liu demonstrate that the exertion of self-control doesn’t just make it harder for us to contain our own anger – it also make us more interested in watching anger-themed movies, or thinking about anger-related information, or looking an angry facial expressions. In other words, acts of self-control haven’t just exhausted the ego – they actually seem to have pissed it off.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">My favorite experiment involved movies. Two hundred and thirty nine subjects were given a choice between a virtuous apple and a hedonistic chocolate bar. (A slim majority chose the apple.) Then, they were offered a selection of movies to watch, from Anger Management (an anger themed film) to Billy Madison (a non-anger themed film.) Interestingly, students were significantly more likely to choose the angry films if they’d first chosen the apple. And it wasn’t just films: another experiment found that people who exercised financial restraint – they chose a gift certificate for groceries over one for spa services – were more interested in looking at angry faces.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">What’s driving this effect? Gal and Liu argue that the preference for angry stuff is not simply a result of ego depletion. Instead, they speculate that self-control is inherently aggravating. Perhaps choosing the apple annoys us because our goals have been thwarted – we really wanted the candy bar – or maybe we’re pissed because we feel that our sense of autonomy has been diminished. (If we weren’t so constrained by societal norms and expectations, we would have gorged on chocolate.) The point is that the labor of self-control directly inspires our tendency towards anger, and not indirectly via a worn down prefrontal cortex.</p> </div></div></blockquote> <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1749711">paper</a><p></p>  also, 2007 <a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Enjdewa2/DeWalletalJESP2007.pdf">study</a><p></p>  I&#8217;ve discussed evidence that <a href="">self-control is weakly trainable</a>, which is of similar quality. So I&#8217;m not inspired (yet) to live a life of soft indulgence alone.

			Never Get Fat. If You&#8217;re Fat, Lose Weight.</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		       <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 13px;">Using data from the <a href="http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);">Framingham Heart Study</a>, 5209 participants were followed up for 48 years from 1948. The current study however only included participants who were free from pre-existing diseases of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The research showed that for those who had a medium number of years lived with obesity (between five years and 14.9 years), the risk of mortality more than doubled than for those who had never been obese. The risk of mortality almost tripled for those with the longest duration of obesity (more than 15 years). Furthermore, the research showed for every additional two years lived with obesity, the risk of mortality increased by between six and seven per cent</span></span></blockquote> <br> <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/mu-tlw032011.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/mu-tlw032011.php</a><p></p>  Of course this is correlation, but I&#8217;ll weakly bet that it&#8217;s causal. Even briefly being extremely fat means you&#8217;re more likely to die (for the rest of your life). You have something like a permanent 100% increase in relative mortality risk (how likely you are to drop dead each day) if you&#8217;re fat for 7 years (but then lose the weight). After that, it&#8217;s more like 4% per year you stay fat. I don&#8217;t know how quickly the risk concentrates in the first year of getting fat, but it&#8217;s probably front-loaded. I also don&#8217;t know if yo-yo fattening/defattening is worse.<p></p>  You should never get fat. Another reason not to, is that fat cells are hormonally active, and don&#8217;t retire when you lose weight; they just become less full of lipds (like an empty balloon). Supposedly an empty fat cell creates roughly as much hunger as a full one. (I don&#8217;t remember the evidence for this, but I believe it).<p></p>  Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t mean stay model-skinny. Just don&#8217;t get fat.

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		      <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/">Let the Right One In</a> was an excellent book, and a good foreign film. Matt Reeves rewrote it as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228987/">Let Me In</a>. It&#8217;s been several months since I saw the foreign version, but this one seems significantly better constructed for the screen - I wasn&#8217;t surprised to hear that the director is the same as the (re)writer. <p></p>  Some cumbersome (for film) elements were pruned or reworked, but it&#8217;s actually slightly longer due to some slow pacing. It&#8217;s dark and beautiful. Both versions are worth watching, but the story does lose impact when you see everything coming. My first exposure, the book, was the most moving.<p></p>  There&#8217;s a little bit of awkwardly animated CG footage. Yes, strong little things can move quickly, but I didn&#8217;t like the overall effect.
