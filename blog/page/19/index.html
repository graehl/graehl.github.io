We&#8217;re often our only advocate. In order to make people trust and like us, we have to promote ourselves. But deception is most effective when we don&#8217;t consciously believe we&#8217;re lying (few people are excellent face-to-face fakers). Biases that help us sell ourselves, or convince the in-group that we&#8217;re loyal to it, will help us. <p></p> 2) Reasonable use of limited computational resources. We employ heuristics that focus our attention, or accelerate a decision, and we should expect those to serve reasonably well in the social+physical environment we evolved in, but to be less accurate than full consideration. That is, our cognitive architecture is mostly satisfactory (but not necessarily optimal) for making decisions given limited computational power and time. It amuses me that it&#8217;s so unusual to really think through a problem in a truly rational and systematic way. <p></p> One error I noticed: &#8220;moral credential effect&#8221; is broader than prejudice. It applies quite generally; if you think you&#8217;ve taken a morally good action today, you&#8217;re more likely to cheat elsewhere. <p></p> There are many overlaps (and several repetitions of some items under different categories): e.g. &#8220;choice-supportive bias&#8221; overlaps &#8220;self-serving bias&#8221; &#8220;dunning-kruger&#8221; and &#8220;hindsight bias&#8221;.

		     Princeton scientists have been claiming that any food that has more fructose than glucose is harmful and obesity-promoting.  Table sugar and bananas, for example, have equal parts fructose and glucose.  HFCS has slightly more fructose than glucose, and many fruits have significantly more (for instance, apples).<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 22px; text-align: left;">In studies directly comparing the effect of fructose and glucose preloads on subsequent food intake, one showed no difference [7], while the majority have shown the fructose preload resulting in lesser food intake than the glucose preload [8-10]. A recent review of the literature on fructose’s effect on satiety found no compelling case for the idea that fructose is less satiating than glucose, or that HFCS is less satiating than sucrose [11].</span></span></blockquote> (from <a href="http://www.alanaragonblog.com/2010/01/29/the-bitter-truth-about-fructose-alarmism/">Alan Aragon</a>)<p></p>  An apple has 10g of fructose.  There&#8217;s no reason to believe that 50g of fructose per day is harmful.

		Good acting. Stylish. I liked most of the shots. I loved a moment of contemplative silence (no soundtrack, just the murmur of the streets at night). Several nearly independent storylines, but often boring writing (not as terrible as Avatar). Critical reviews are mostly negative, which seems wrong to me. Training Day (same director) was better, but this was fine.

Drawing from a limited-resource model of self-regulation and executive function, the authors hypothesized that decision making depletes the same resource used for self-control and active responding. In 4 laboratory studies, some participants made choices among consumer goods or college course options, whereas others thought about the same options without making choices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
</div>
<span style="vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: underline;">Making choices led to reduced self-control (i.e., less physical stamina, reduced persistence in the face of failure, more procrastination, and less quality and quantity of arithmetic calculations). A field study then found that reduced self-control was predicted by shoppers&#8217; self-reported degree of previous active decision making. Further studies suggested that choosing is more depleting than merely deliberating and forming preferences about options and more depleting than implementing choices made by someone else and that anticipating the choice task as enjoyable can reduce the depleting effect for the first choices but not for many choices.</span>

			Inglorious Basterds, Avatar, Up in the Air, Sherlock Holmes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Avatar was very fun in 3d, and although it seemed incredibly dumb at times, even Lucas-like in dialog, it showed a type of spare simplicity and good taste that I didn&#8217;t see in the Star Wars prequels. Tarantino is getting even better. I love his musical direction, his tense setups, his delightful gore, even his witty banter. It&#8217;s nice that he didn&#8217;t act in this film. Basterds is my favorite recently made movie. <p></p> Up in the Air bored me intensely. We left after 40 minutes of one-note wanna-cutesiness. I may finish it one day on DVD. Instead we saw Sherlock Holmes, which was also utterly boring as far as interaction between or development of characters, but offered some momentary visual and technical charms. Fun slo-mo fight w/ incredible planning (as in absolutely unbelievable; Holmes must be seen as a comic superhero, which I gladly grant). I&#8217;d say this is the same type of movie as da Vinci Code, only with a more pleasing style and lead. I love Tom Hanks but his da Vinci character (Dr. Robert Landon?) is boring as fuck.

		      I&#8217;ve quoted selectively from <a href="http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-5-interval-training-part-2.html">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-5-interval-training-part-2.html</a><br> which is quite long.<p></p>  Adaptation to both varieties of anaerobic intervals below seems to reach diminishing returns after just 2-3 weeks (6 sessions).<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><div style="border-collapse: separate;

font-family: Arial,Tahoma,Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: justify;"> <p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px;">Training anaerobic power is pretty much what you’d imagine.  Generally work bouts lasting 30-60 seconds are used with fairly long rest intervals.  For a one minute maximum effort, a rest interval of 4-5 minutes of easy recovery might be taken.  The idea, essentially is to generate a lot of power (and a lot of waste products, some have even called this lactate production training) during the work bout and then give the body a chance to clear it during recovery.  That’s then repeated a number of times (perhaps 8-10 in total depending).</p> <p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px;">Anaerobic capacity training, as noted above, is more along the lines of repeated longer repeated efforts (60-90 seconds) with rest intervals of perhaps 1:1 (so 60 seconds rest for a 60 second interval, 90 seconds for a 90 second interval).  Intensity has to be lower here and the goal is to maintain power output against increasing fatigue (some used to call this lactate tolerance training).</p> </div></div></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate;

font-family: Arial,Tahoma,Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: justify;">this energy system is not massively trainable.  Certainly buffering capacity can be improved (and science continues to understand the adaptations involved) but overall improving the power or capacity of this pathway is relatively limited; you put in a lot of very hard, very draining work for not a lot of payback.</span></span></blockquote> <br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman;

font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: justify;">the adaptations to this type of training occur quickly but then stop just as rapidly.  Studies find that the improvements to this type of work typically stop after about 3 weeks.  In one study of cyclists, 12 HIIT workouts over 6 weeks generated no better improvements in performance than was seen after the first 6 workouts over 3 weeks.</span></span></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate;

font-family: Arial,Tahoma,Verdana; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: justify;">the high acid production caused by these types of anaerobic intervals may damage mitochondria and overall endurance especially if it’s not balanced by sufficient low intensity work (Lydiard, for example, was adamant that anaerobic work never be performed while building the aerobic engine).  This was an older idea that has seen recent scientific validation: in a recent study, individuals who consumed bicarbonate prior to training obtained better aerobic adaptations, presumably by buffering acidosis<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <br> </span></span></span></blockquote> Aerobic training for VO2 max also reaches diminishing returns in just 3-8 weeks (8 weeks starting from a very weak base).<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate;

		     Iain Banks is a great writer and an interesting thinker.  When his characters muse, I&#8217;m actually amused by their perceptiveness.  I&#8217;ve liked everything of his I&#8217;ve read so far (including the non-science-fiction e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wasp-Factory-Novel-Iain-Banks/dp/0684853159/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258427772&amp;sr=1-1">The Wasp Factory</a>).  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transition-Iain-M-Banks/dp/0316071986/ref=pd_sim_b_2">Transition</a> is fun: a minority of people can travel between the quantum many-worlds as bodysnatchers.  They tweak the worlds to their liking (out of altruism, of course).  The ending is a relative mess (a super powerful being provides the resolution), but it was a fun ride.  Of course it&#8217;s impossible to really believe in the pretend science, but it&#8217;s still much tidier than your typical hollywood bullshit.

		     Paul McAuley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-War-Paul-McAuley-GollanczF/dp/0575079339">Quiet War</a> was a little preachy, and the conclusion was almost as much a hamhanded letdown from the momentum established in the beginning of Stephenson&#8217;s Diamond Age, but I still enjoyed it.  Several characters are trapped in annoying situations by powerful people who use them, which almost made me feel resentful toward the author, who was really at fault.  I like the author&#8217;s vision of explicitly engineered ecosystems in space and on earth.  I&#8217;d read this author again.

		     The (South) Korean film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldboy">Oldboy</a> is pure joy.  My only complaint is with one silly, but fun, 1 vs. 20 hallway fight.  <p></p>  Spielberg wants to do a remake without the incest (apparently based on the manga and not the movie).  I expect it will be worse in any case.  <p></p>  The english dub was the default, and in the very first minute it was evident that it was absolutely awful.  Subtitles should be mandatory, because without it you lose most of the power of the great acting by the two male leads (the woman who plays Mi-do is also very good).

Revision indicated that even these writers shouldn&#8217;t be considered godlike figures from whom the muse poured forth perfection on the first try, but writers who are—in some ways—like other writers, in at least this respect: They were subject to second thoughts.<span> <br> </span></span></span></blockquote>
<p>This popped out at me while skimming a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2229224/pagenum/all">fawning piece on Nabokov</a>, who must have died recently.</p>
<p></p>  I thought it was well-known that any artistic, musical, literary, mathematical, or engineering genius both used writing to enhance their mental working space, and improved substantially on their work by revision.  I&#8217;d say whatever exceptions there are (who did it <em>all</em> in their head and submitted only first drafts), could have been better had they edited.  If they didn&#8217;t edit or redraft, all I&#8217;d say is that they didn&#8217;t find the activity rewarding, not that it wouldn&#8217;t have helped.<p></p>  I&#8217;m not saying that the most-revised work is always the best (though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert">Madame Bovary</a> may be excellent; I haven&#8217;t read it).<p></p>  It was seeing this edit of Kafka&#8217;s work by Nabokov in my RSS reader that started me wondering if Nabokov was dead:<br> <div class="p_embed p_image_embed">

<br> On the whole, the edits improve it.  I&#8217;ve never read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov">Nabokov</a> - but I think I will, soon.
