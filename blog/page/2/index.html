			Claims From Research on Programming</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Some claims with empirical studies behind them from <a href="http://vimeo.com/9270320" target="_blank">a talk by Greg Wilson</a>:
<div>
<ul>
<li>(working?) lines of code written per time is the same for high and low level languages</li>
<li>25% increase in size of program description = doubling of program size (interactions?)</li>
<li>code review is worth doing; almost all the benefit comes from the first review. (<a href="http://smartbear.com/SmartBear/media/pdfs/best-kept-secrets-of-peer-code-review.pdf" target="_blank">Cohen 2006</a>)</li>
<li>most people don&#8217;t find anything useful when continuing to read code past the first hour. (Cohen 2006).</li>
<li>(post-compile?) 60-90% of bugs can be found before first execution by reading code. this beats writing unit tests (although those can be re-run to detect future regressions, at least)</li>
<li>the rate of review that finds bugs in that hour (maximum) is a few hundred lines max</li>
<li>telling people that programming ability is mostly talent/genetic based vs. telling them it relies on practice: both men and women do worse - not trying as hard when they hit an obstacle?</li>
<li>physical distance: being near or cross-country (or even +9 hours) doesn&#8217;t impact (released) bug rate</li>
<li>distance in org chart: collaboration between programmers far apart in org tree means higher bug rate (I don&#8217;t think this implies that if you give two groups of people an identical task starting from scratch, then a different org chart will change things much; rather, I guess that the tasks that rope together different-domain software teams&#8217; expertise and/or systems are inherently harder)</li>
<li>no code metric as of 2001 predicts bugs; all the benefit comes from code size of a program (more code -&gt; more bugs)</li>
<li>anchoring (or perhaps the subservient desire to not disappoint by seeming incompetent) applies strongly to implementation time estimates no matter how experienced the programmer or low-authority (&#8220;I know nothing about software but I think this should take about &#8230; 3 weeks &#8230; 20 weeks&#8221;)</li>
<li>bugs that are fixed later in development are more expensive (by what measure?) than those caught earlier (because the cheap ones are easy to spot?)</li>
</ul>
<div>(disclaimer: most studies of software programming productivity are not blind controlled studies, are mere correlations, use an undergrad population, and/or have data consisting of fewer than 100 person-hours)</div>

			Low Cholesterol Kills</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>Prestigious U.S. medicine (which is often fantastic) is wrongly advises low fat high carb diets, overtreats moderately high blood pressure, overprescribes NSAIDs and antibiotics, overtests for breast cancer, underprescribes sunlight and vitamin D, and, it seems, kills people by lowering their cholesterol w/ dangerous statins.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The low-cholesterol state doctors try to keep us in is actually associated with the most death (though this could merely be that old and dying people are made to lower their cholesterol, and if young people lowered it they would be fine or even healthier)<br>

For both men and women, the lowest levels of total cholesterol (below 5.0 mmol/L) were associated with the <strong>most</strong> death. For men, the best level was intermediate — what the Mayo Clinic calls “borderline high”. For women, the safest levels were the highest.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">If high cholesterol causes heart disease, as we are so often told, the pattern for women makes no sense. For a long time, experts have told us to limit egg consumption because eggs are high in cholesterol. However,  a <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8539" target="_blank">new study</a> shows that egg consumption has no association with heart disease risk.</p>

			The Slightly Overweight Live Longest</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Warning: uncontrolled correlation. Do not act upon in any way. Married people live longer and are heavier. Sick, smokers, and drug addicted people lose weight. Body-image conscious dieters may eat unhealthily. Bicyclists are killed in droves. Muscle shows up as higher body mass index just the same as deadly beer-belly flab. Women (who live a few years longer than men) are fatter than men. <br><div>
<div>Nonetheless, a meta-analysis shows that it&#8217;s the overweight (BMI 25-30) who have the lowest all-cause mortality. Hazard ratios (1 is more risk):</div> <p></p>
<div> <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51); font-family: Georgia,Cambria,Times,Times New Roman,serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96) for overweight, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.12-1.25) for obesity (all grades combined), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.88-1.01) for grade 1 obesity, and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.18-1.41) for grades 2 and 3 obesity.</span>

<div>If you happen to be not-fat and are pursuing safe diet+exercise without obsessive stress and self-denial, you certainly shouldn&#8217;t try to put on weight after hearing about this correlation (which is statistically robust but, probably explained away by the average causes of being slightly overweight, not a consequence of being overweight).</div> <p></p>
<div>I do find it plausible that being slightly overweight has both harms and benefits, though. Supposedly it&#8217;s when you have a fat belly (especially visceral fat under the abs) that you get most of the harms.</div>

Several recent news stories suggest no, they aren’t. Failure to tell patients the full risks of medical treatment may be common:</p> <p style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">1. <strong>Undisclosed risks of hernia surgery</strong>. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203833004577249344022834000.html?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn_Life%26Culture" target="_blank">From the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>: “More than 30% of patients may suffer from long-term chronic pain and restricted movement after surgery to fix a hernia &#8230; studies show.” The article says “many patients don’t consider” this risk — meaning they don’t know about it. A Berkeley surgeon named Eileen Consorti told me I should have surgery for a hernia I could not detect. I have previously written about her claim that evidence supported her recommendation when no such evidence existed — or, at least, no one including her has ever found it. I  said I wanted to see the evidence because there were risks to surgery. She replied that none of her patients had died. I was shocked by the incompleteness of her answer. There are plenty of bad outcomes besides death — as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article shows.</p> <p style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">2. <strong>Undisclosed risks of sleeping pills</strong>. A book called <a href="http://www.darksideofsleepingpills.com/index.html" target="_blank"><em>The Dark Side of Sleeping Pills</em></a> by Daniel Kripke, a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego, goes into great detail about risks of sleeping pills that few doctors tell their patients. For example, one study found that “patients who took sleeping pills died 4.6 times as often during follow-ups averaging 2.5 years [than matched patients who did not take sleeping pills]. Patients who took higher doses (averaging over 132 pills per year) died 5.3 times as often.” Insomnia alone was not associated with higher mortality. Tomorrow I will post Dr. Kripke’s answer to the question “why did you write this book?” <a href="http://ambienoverdose.org/" target="_blank">Here is a website</a> about the dangers of Ambien.</p> <p style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">3. <strong>Undisclosed risks of anticholinergic drugs</strong>. <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/cocktail-of-popular-drugs-may-cloud-brain/" target="_blank">From the </a><em><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/cocktail-of-popular-drugs-may-cloud-brain/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>:</em> “After <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21707557" title="An abstract of the study." target="_blank">following more than 13,000 British men and women</a> 65 or older for two years, researchers found that those taking more than one anticholinergic drug scored lower on tests of cognitive function than those who were not using any such drugs, and that the death rate for the heavy users during the course of the study was 68 percent higher. That finding, reported last July in The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, stunned the investigators.” Anticholinergics are “very very common” said a researcher. They include many over-the-counter drugs, such as “allergy medications, antihistamines and Tylenol PM”.</p> <p style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">4. <strong>Undisclosed risks of statins</strong>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/health/fda-warns-of-cholesterol-drugs-side-effects.html" target="_blank">A recent <em>NY Times</em> story</a> says “the Food and Drug Administration has officially linked statin use with cognitive problems like forgetfulness and confusion, although some patients have reported such problems for years. Among the drugs affected are huge sellers like Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor and Vytorin.” Prior to this official linkage, the reports of forgetfulness and confusion were mere anecdotes that evidence-based medicine proponents ignore and tell the rest of us to ignore.</p> <p style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">5. <strong>Undisclosed risks of metal-on-metal hip replacements</strong>. They leak dangerous amounts of metal (e.g., cobalt) into the rest of the body. “Despite the fact that these risks have been known and well documented for decades, patients have been kept in the dark,” says <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e1410" target="_blank">a recent article in the <em>BMJ</em></a>. By 2007, the danger was so clear that a British regulatory committee said that patients must sign a form saying they’ve been warned. This didn’t happen — a surgeon told the BMJ that “surgeons were unaware of these discussions.” Other materials could have been used.</p> </blockquote>

			King of Mountain Status: +1 Year Alive</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		From <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2013/01/10/how-to-live-longer-a-new-marketplace-podcast/">a Freakonomics podcast</a>, we hear how apex status (Nobel prize, Oscar, Baseball hall of fame, etc) extends lifespan about a year (assuming their non-controlled model passes the usual correlation-is-not-causation hurdles), and being nominated but losing doesn&#8217;t do it: <div> <p></p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: rgb(204,204,204); border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">
<span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> Research shows that </span><a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/250021?uid=3739808&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101548765811" target="_blank" style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">people who buy annuities tend to live longer</a><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> – and not just because they are the kind of people that have the money to buy annuities to start with. It’s apparently that little extra incentive of the annuity payout that keeps people going.</span>
</blockquote> <p></p>
<div>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s rather more likely adverse selection - those with private info about their ability and intent to live a longer, healthier life are more likely to convert their savings into an annuity. Also, such a decision is just one of many conscientious, risk-averse behaviors, some of which probably extend lifespan. Though I am sympathetic to their fanciful story - &#8220;make my decision to buy an annuity a good one by holding on a year longer&#8221; reminds me of the sunk-cost fallacy and wanting to avoid admitting a mistake. Also, people who run out of money (didn&#8217;t buy an annuity) might die soon after - if only from the stress of managing the last fumes in their tank.</div> </div>

			Thyme and Curcumin (Turmeric) Reduce Inflammation</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Vioxx (the heart-disease cover-up scandal drug that killed thousands) selectively inhibited an inflammation-causing thing called &#8220;COX-2&#8221;. It turns out that thyme significantly inhibits it also (but clove, rose, eucalyptus, fennel, and bergamot - also part of herbal remedy folklore - do not) - <a href="http://www.jlr.org/content/51/1/132.full.pdf">study</a>. I assume thyme doesn&#8217;t kill people like Vioxx does, but large doses of any herb might at least upset your stomach. Thyme is also <a href="http://www.sgm.ac.uk/news/releases/DUB12_MGE.cfm">useful in treating acne</a>.<br> <p></p>

			Aging Sperm</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial,sans-serif;">A Stanford study claims that older-age fathers <a href="http://scienceblog.com/14203/old-men-chasing-young-women-a-good-thing/" target="_blank">promote longevity in the population</a>.</p> <p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial,sans-serif;">But <a href="http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/talkin-bout-their-generations/">old-age male sperm has more random mutations</a> (another 2 per year of father&#8217;s age, usually bad, of course, but out of 1.6 billion or so, probably mostly harmless), so this means more losers even though those who reproduce are going to have better long-life-promoting genes. </p> <p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial,sans-serif;">It turns out that the mother&#8217;s contribution to mutational load is constant (because the eggs were produced earlier?); the benefits of younger motherhood come from elsewhere. Still, older fathers aren&#8217;t unambiguously awful; mutational load aside, it may be general health more than just age that&#8217;s at work in reducing older men&#8217;s sperm quality.</p> <p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial,sans-serif;"></p>
<p><br class="">1. <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/335999" target="_blank"> Exericse improves sperm</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diana Vaamonde, a researcher at the University of Cordoba and lead author of the study said in a press release, “We have analysed qualitative semen parameters like the ejaculated volume, sperm count, mobility and sperm morphology.” [that&#8217;s what *she* said!]<br> </p>
<p>For the study the men were also tested for hormone levels that included follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), cortisol (C) and the T/C ratio that the researchers explain provides a better picture of the environment needed for sperm creation, in addition to giving a picture of the general health of the 31 men included in the study.</p> <p>The results showed men who exercise more had faster swimming sperm that was more perfectly formed, compared to their sedentary counterparts. Exercising appears to create a more favorable environment for sperm creation that comes from healthy hormone levels.</p> <p>The good news is the researchers say it only takes moderate exercise to keep your sperm in good shape.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/infertility.cfm#b" target="_blank">CDC,</a> it’s possible to change a man’s sperm with healthy lifestyle changes.</p> </blockquote>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/09/18/antioxidants-tied-to-older-men-sperm-quality-study-finds/" target="_blank">Diet improves sperm</a> in 45+ year old men.<br></p>
<p>3. A <a href="http://www.livescience.com/6080-autism-rates-higher-children-older-moms.html" target="_blank">study</a> finds that the risk of autism goes up considerably more in the children of older mothers in all age ranges than it does in the children of older fathers.</p> <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The older a mother is when she gives birth, the higher her child’s risk of autism, new data show.</p>
<p>A smaller effect also is seen for the age of the father, but only when the child is born to a father over age 40 and a mother under age 30.</p> </blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial,sans-serif;">All of the above are just studies of correlations in existing populations, of course. There was no control group.</p>
