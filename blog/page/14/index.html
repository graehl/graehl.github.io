The left brain tries to fit the data to the theory to preserve a coherent internal narrative and prevent a person from jumping back and forth between conclusions upon each new data point. It is primarily an apologist, there to explain why any experience is exactly what its own theory would have predicted. The right brain is the seat of the <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues" style="color: #3d3d3e; text-decoration: underline;">second virtue</a>.

Maybe the intense sensory input from an unexpected source makes the right hemisphere unusually aroused. Maybe distoring the balance sense causes the eyes to move rapidly, activating a latent system for inter-hemisphere co-ordination usually restricted to REM sleep<sup>3</sup>. In any case, a patient who has been denying paralysis for weeks or months will, upon having cold water placed in the ear, admit to paralysis, admit to having been paralyzed the past few weeks or months, and express bewilderment at having ever denied such an obvious fact. And then the effect wears off, and the patient not only denies the paralysis but denies ever having admitted to it.</span></blockquote>
<p>via <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/20/the_apologist_and_the_revolutionary/">Yvain</a></p>

<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #f7f7f8; font-size: small;">
</span><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">One of the things that has always baffled me about psychedelics such as LSD, LSA or psilocybin (the active ingredient of &#8220;magic mushrooms&#8221;) is that their actions seem far too specific to be caused by a simple substance.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">The effect I am referring to is that for some people and in some contexts, they cause what is often called a spiritual experience, i.e., experience that is deeply meaningful to the user and possibly long-term world-view (and behaviour) altering.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">Look for example at<span> </span><a href="http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=6693" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">this study</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">There&#8217;s also this<span> </span><a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00302744?order=1" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">active study</a><span> </span>which is the object of a 12 minute report available<span> </span><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;oi=video_result&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJASWFASqcps&amp;ei=ohL2SdRkxtH5BrWrpboP&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGfD7vagWcpQFE_nuMFaqnHCyvmA&amp;sig2=FMfu2nfKluLCnHFdkTTTYQ" rel="nofollow" style="color: #6a8a6b; text-decoration: underline;">on Youtube</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">From my limited experience, and from what I observed in friends, I would say that psychedelics can be used to increase rationality, specifically by eliminating those sources of irrationality stemming from self-deception. They seem to allow the reexamination of deeply ingrained beliefs about the self and the world, that are beyond everyday reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>via comment on Yvain&#8217;s piece</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #f7f7f8; font-size: small;">If activating the right hemisphere leads to the ability to overturn current beliefs, why does the patient go back to their old beliefs after the effects wear off?</span></blockquote>
<p>Good objection. But those people are brain-damaged. Maybe in normal people the insight will stick. If you try it, videotape yourself, just in case you revert.</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">When this test is done to patients in a hospital, the patient is lying in bed on his back facing upward towards the ceiling. Ice cold water, 60 ml total, is introduced into one ear canal using a syringe. This is repeated in the other ear canal.</span></blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>

Unlike glucose, fructose does not stimulate insulin release. Metabolism of fructose depletes intracellular energy stores (ATP), and induces uric acid production.<span class="superscript" style="font-size: 9px; vertical-align: top;">14</span>

The reduction in glucose metabolism, in turn, causes insulin levels to rise so that glucose is taken up in alternative sites, such as muscle tissue. Such high insulin levels leads to compensatory insulin resistance in muscle tissue.<span class="superscript" style="font-size: 9px; vertical-align: top;">14</span><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This mechanism may explain how fructose has little acute effect on serum glucose levels, but importantly, impairs glycaemic control after long-term exposure to high doses.

			Chewing Gum Increases Alertness</a>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">
</span><blockquote>
<p><strong>Effects of chewing gum on cognitive function, mood and physiology in stressed and non-stressed volunteers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RATIONALE</strong>:</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that chewing gum may improve aspects of cognitive function and mood. There is also evidence suggesting that chewing gum reduces stress. It is important, therefore, to examine these two areas and to determine whether contextual factors (chewing habit, type of gum, and personality) modify such effects.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>:</p>
<p>The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine whether chewing gum improved mood and mental performance; (ii) to determine whether chewing gum had benefits in stressed individuals; and (iii) to determine whether chewing habit, type of gum and level of anxiety modified the effects of gum.</p>
<p><strong>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:</strong></p>
<p>A cross-over study involving 133 volunteers was carried out. Each volunteer carried out a test session when they were chewing gum and without gum, with order of gum conditions counterbalanced across subjects. Baseline sessions were conducted prior to each test session. Approximately half of the volunteers were tested in 75 dBA noise (the stress condition) and the rest in quiet. Volunteers were stratified on chewing habit and anxiety level. Approximately, half of the volunteers were given mint gum and half fruit gum. The volunteers rated their mood at the start and end of each session and had their heart rate monitored over the session. Saliva samples were taken to allow cortisol levels (good indicator of alertness and stress) to be assayed. During the session, volunteers carried out tasks measuring a range of cognitive functions (aspects of memory, selective and sustained attention, psychomotor speed and accuracy).</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong>:</p>
<p>Chewing gum was associated with greater alertness and a more positive mood. Reaction times were quicker in the gum condition, and this effect became bigger as the task became more difficult. Chewing gum also improved selective and sustained attention. Heart rate and cortisol levels were higher when chewing which confirms the alerting effect of chewing gum.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>:</p>
<p>Overall, the r<strong>esults suggest that chewing gum produces a number of benefits that are generally observed and not context-dependent.</strong><span> </span>In contrast to some previous research, chewing gum failed to improve memory. Further research is now required to increase our knowledge of the behavioral effects of chewing gum and to identify the underlying mechanisms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe cortisol goes up with any physical activity.</p>
<p>Chewing gum might be bad for you in other ways (e.g. possible jaw RSI).</p>
<p>The improved focus and mood works under the quiet or the distressingly-loud-noise condition.</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~graehl/papers/null.multivitamin.pdf">study</a></p>
<p>The 1.07 hazard ratio (7% higher chance of dropping dead at any moment) for men is indeed not significant; a simpler model that doesn&#8217;t control for as many things (including use of some single supplement e.g. selenium) gives a HR=.99, for example.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s unlikely that vitamins do nothing. Yet they appear to, in this fairly large study of old people. I&#8217;d say this is reason to look at fine-tuning vitamin/mineral intake. Those men who took 1-6/week instead of 1x or 2x/day seemed to fare slightly better than 0/week (TOTALLY not significant though).<p></p>  Too much of some things in diet+multivitamin is likely quite harmful to health. If you ignore statistical significance, the weak evidence is that those old people who take multivitamins for a 5 year stretch are slightly more likely to end up dead 10-15 years later.<p></p>  Or, supposing that multivitamins aren&#8217;t harmful (they obviously vary tremendously in composition), it&#8217;s really true that it&#8217;s unlikely that your normal diet is lacking anything you need, and the non-significant effect is mostly due to confounds like taking vitamins because you feel your health start to fail, or taking vitamins because you live a healthy lifestyle already, etc.<p></p>  Unfortunately, that multivitamins do nothing, or are both helpful and harmful, with the harms slightly outweighing the benefits, is the simplest explanation of many such null results in the literature. But I don&#8217;t want to accept it, because I know of some specific causal evidence suggesting that individual vitamins, when supplemented, yield health benefits in a majority of people. So I&#8217;ll hold the slightly more complicated: &#8220;most multivitamins are too-highly dosing at least a few things, in a way that harms health as much as the rest of it benefits health&#8221;, tentatively.<p></p>  Another nearly siginificant pattern: people who&#8217;ve used vitamins for at least 5 years die less than those who recently started or never used (but again, not really significant). Motivated speculation (not wanting to believe multi-vitamins are actually net-harmful or -useless): old people who suddenly start taking multivitamins did so due to correctly feeling their declining health and imminent death. So their higher rate of death shouldn&#8217;t be blamed on having recently started multivitamins.

<p>uh-oh. i like my high-protein diet. i need muscles to do well in soccer and volleyball. and it&#8217;s easy not to overeat when you&#8217;re not craving protein. this suggests a benefit from titrating protein somehow (being sensitive to how much of it you need for your activity level).</p>

As a result, protein appetite drives overconsumption of energy on low percent protein diets, promoting obesity and metabolic disorders with consequent effects on longevity</span></blockquote>
<p>so, be skinny, on as little protein as you can get away with (obviously you&#8217;ll die with 0 protein in your diet; likewise with 0 fat).</p>

This may not result from benefits associated with CR per se, but rather reflect the costs of nutrient imbalance when feeding ad libitum on a fixed diet. As the required balance of nutrients changes over time (with time of day, season, growth and development, and senescence), animals will be forced to overeat some nutrients to gain enough of others</span></blockquote>
<p>speculation without evidence - they seem to be suggesting that ideally you eat the minimum amount of food necessary for all vitamin / macronutrient needs. but it&#8217;s also true that if you have excess body fat, you&#8217;ll survive surgery better. some excess makes you more robust. we can&#8217;t really titrate perfectly.</p>
<p></p>  i suppose the overall question would be: how much quality of life do you have to sacrifice by risking insufficient intake of various nutrients, in order to maybe live longer? nobody knows the answer for humans, yet.<p></p>

On the other hand, it&#8217;s nice for removing uranium from the body. It also reduces colon cancer. It penetrates the brain and can protect neurons there by chelating iron (which I guess you don&#8217;t want in the brain - iron does get in there somehow and exacerbates many brain diseases).<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Grain consumption has long been known to damage vitamin D status and bone health.

<p></p>  You need DHA in your diet (EPA can be synthesized from ALA, which is in flaxseed oil; DHA barely can). But high levels of polyunsaturated fats may be dangerous; they&#8217;re easily oxidized (anecdotal evidence; natural diets don&#8217;t have high levels, unless they&#8217;re mostly fish):<p></p>  You can supplement DHA from some particular type of seaweed (I forget the details), or in many fatty fish or their extracted oil (watch your mercury). It does occur naturally in lesser quantities in various other foods. DHA lowers testosterone, but it has many good effects. Lower testosterone means more (harmless, operable) prostate cancer, but possibly more frequent severe cases:<p></p>

Another reason to eat a high-fat diet.</span></blockquote>
<p>(the ratio matters; eat more saturated fat to mitigate the harms while still getting some of the benefits of DHA)</p>

</span><p>Most Americans eat far too much omega-6, and their omega-6 to omega-3 tissue ratio is too high, which is pro-inflammatory via the COX-2 pathway. Eating omega-3s including DHA reduces inflammation by downregulating the COX-2 pathway. This accounts for the well-attested benefits of DHA against cardiovascular disease. Now, cancer is promoted by COX-2 pathway inflammation, which is why COX-2 inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen are protective against cancer. [4] DHA’s action to downregulate this pathway must generate an anti-cancer effect. But, unlike aspirin and ibuprofen, DHA has no observable effect on overall cancer risk. This suggests that<span> </span><strong><em>DHA has other effects, unrelated to its anti-inflammatory activity, that are cancer promoting</em></strong>. These counterbalance the benefits from its anti-inflammatory effect. If DHA has pro-angiogenic effects that are independent of COX-2 mediated inflammation, then this could account for the observations.</p>
<p>One reason an association of DHA with high-grade cancer may have been missed is that it would be detected only in large studies able to segregate cancers by grade.</p>

<p>AMD = why 1/3 of people 75+ yr old are nearly blind. DHA is the only cause of CEP. It&#8217;s caused by excessive growth of blood vessels dislodging the retina. DHA is concentrated near the retina (is 80% of the PUFA in it). Photons cause oxidation, and DHA is extremely oxidizable. Antioxidants help slow AMD. Finally, adding CEP directly to mice causes AMD (this was shown in 2003). (we know now it&#8217;s because CEP causes angiogensis).</p>
<p></p>  CEP is normally good. It brings immune cells from bone marrow to the wound. Cancers and AMD give chronic CEP elevation. CEP actually causes wound healing even in mice with normal wound healing mechanisms crippled (VEGF and TLR2 knocked-out or inhibited) - this was shown in 2010. VEGF causes angiogenesis when tissue is oxygen deprived. TLR2 causes angiogenesis when it detects oxidative stress.<p></p>  vitamin A + DHA yield CEP (via retinyl from A + HOHA=oxidized DHA).<p></p>  If you&#8217;re going to take DHA (usually fish oil) you&#8217;ll want anti-oxidants. Oxidation can&#8217;t be avoided; it&#8217;s essential to metabolism and fighting infection.<p></p>

Moderate omega-3 consumption is especially important for those suffering from diseases of pathological angiogenesis – especially cancer. DHA is essential for good health – but in excess, it is probably dangerous.</span></blockquote>

This made big difference for about 3 months, then seemed to not work any more. I talked to a nutritionist friend and she pointed out that according to Andrew Stoll (The Omega 3 Connection) you must take 1000 mg vit C and 500 iu vit E daily or the omega 3 becomes oxidised in your body (cell membranes) and ineffective. I started taking both and in days was back to the original anti-inflammatory effectiveness of omega 3. I have since talked to others about this – for example a psychiatrist whose clients did well on omega 3 for 3 months and then it became ineffective.</span></blockquote>
<p>quite anecdotal - needs actual research. but the fact that omega-3 are easily oxidized means they might degrade vit-C (which means you need enough carbs+selenium in your diet to move the DHAA out of the bloodstream into cells for reconversion to C, or you just need to bear the harm of DHAA and supplement more C. In general, vit E supplementation is quite harmful. I wouldn&#8217;t do it unless strong evidence revealed that it&#8217;s okay when you have high omega-3 intake.</p>

		      There isn&#8217;t an obvious minimum required amount of carbs in the human diet.<p></p>  However, a diet too low in carb+protein calories is definitely bad. <p></p>  Further, when fighting infection, it&#8217;s tricky to give your body what it needs if you&#8217;re not getting enough carbs. Without enough (protein or carbs) you won&#8217;t get the insulin needed to recycle oxidized vitamin c produced when fighting infection (you can supplement C, but the unrecycled oxidized byproduct is itself harmful). If you must have a near-0-carb diet, you should supplement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine">NAC</a>, selenium, zinc, copper, coenzyme Q10, ALA, and colorful veggies/berries, especially if fighting infection.<p></p>  It&#8217;s almost impossible to make animals carb-deficient; they have large livers (which manufacture glucose) relative to their small brains&#8217; glucose needs.<p></p>  Glucose is needed for immune function and mucus. <p></p>  If your mucus is low enough, you&#8217;ll get far more constipation and gut cancers, as do people who&#8217;ve followed the &#8220;Optimal Diet&#8221; popular in Poland.

If that happens, you definitely need more glucose (meaning more protein possibly, but the simplest solution is to add slightly more carbs).

The point missed is that the limiting part in nonenzymatic free radical scavenging is the rate at which extra high-energy electrons are provided through NADH to re-reduce the vitamin C and other free radical scavengers. When ill, free radicals are formed at a rate faster than the high-energy electrons are made available. Doses of vitamin C as large as 1-10 g per 24 h do only limited good. However, when ascorbate is used in massive amounts, such as 30-200+ g per 24 h, these amounts directly provide the electrons necessary to quench the free radicals of almost any inflammation. Additionally, in high concentrations ascorbate reduces NAD(P)H and therefore can provide the high-energy electrons necessary to reduce the molecular oxygen used in the respiratory burst of phagocytes. In these functions, the ascorbate part is mostly wasted but the necessary high-energy electrons are provided in large amounts.</span></blockquote> I guess my speculation above is right.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Another early view was that vitamin C helps by destroying histamine, which may be produced in excess under conditions of stress.</span></blockquote> &#8220;early view&#8221;? sounds like it&#8217;s not a good view :)<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate, has strong antiviral activity in vitro.</span></blockquote> DHAA is the (harmful) used vit-C byproduct that&#8217;s normally recycled. <br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>in clinical experience, vitamin C is most effective against viral infections.</span></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Since animals upregulate ascorbate production under all kinds of stress, not just viral infections, it seems probable that vitamin C aids health by multiple pathways, not only by antiviral activity.</span></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vitamin C is extremely safe.

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ignoring the superstitious pseudo-evolutionary constellation of beliefs associated with it, I think &#8220;paleo&#8221; believers are doing a good job noticing severe flaws in conventional diet and health advice. The main dietary themes seem to me: plenty of protein is good, saturated animal fat is good, non-contaminated fish are good, colorful vegetables are good, high carbs (as far as it causes high insulin or appetite) is bad, fructose is bad (oddly, they usually recommend fruits anyway, especially berries), nuts+avocados are good, grains are bad (they&#8217;re divided on that; some people legitimately suffer from grains - tubers/squashes instead), full-fat and/or fermented dairy is better than low-fat (also divided; over half the world is lactose intolerant, so non-fermented dairy would be a bad idea for them), and, in terms of supplementation: plenty of DHA (fish oil) and vitamin D (sunlight or pills), otherwise RDA plus a little.</p>
<p></p>

Probably healthy enough but it won&#8217;t support intense physical activity.<p></p>  Some smart folks have noticed that you have at least initial success with low-food-reward calorie consumption (basically: don&#8217;t combine a source of calories with something that&#8217;s fun to eat). e.g. <a href="http://www.sethroberts.net/">Seth Roberts</a><p></p>  This guy dissents:

<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px 1em;">I think our evolved preference for tasty foods including starches, fat, salt, and other “high reward” flavors indicates they are healthy, and therefore that a diet rich in such foods is most likely to cure metabolic damage.</li>
<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px 1em;">I think it is essential to stay away from toxic, malnourishing foods made from wheat, fructose sugars, omega-6 oils, and bioactive compounds like MSG; and instead to eat foods that accord with our evolutionary history.</li>
</ul>

<p>By metabolic damage, he means one of many possible things that can go wrong, with fat cells, the brain, hormones, whatever (really yet to be completely discovered). He objects to focusing on food-reward because he thinks that the fact that low-reward diets&#8217; initial effectiveness is almost never sustained. By the way, the concept of &#8220;metabolic damage&#8221; being responsible for obesity is controversial amongst the &#8220;fat people have no willpower&#8221; crowd, but clearly diabetes fits the description.</p>
<p></p>  Don&#8217;t supplement with too much calcium. Not only does high calcium prevent bone turnover (which you want), but it prevents magnesium absorption (oddly enough, supplementing magnesium will also help calcium reach bones).

<p>I started to get a little body acne after supplementing with 4000 IU D daily (especially once I started getting an hour of sun daily). I figured that was due to excess D (it&#8217;s fat soluble and so a dose that was fine for a few weeks may be too much once you&#8217;re saturated) but perhaps it was just giving me steroid-like side effects :) In any case, I cut back on the D supplementation (you can&#8217;t get too much D from sun, fortunately - the body scales back when it&#8217;s not needed).</p>

<p></p>  Conventional wisdom aside, it&#8217;s generally thought that people universally prefer lighter skin and (lesser known) yellower skin, which is a sign of high carotenoids, which are a sign for (cause of, probably) a healthier immune system. So it would make sense that people instinctively prefer yellower skin. Perhaps the fake orange tan is more attractive than a real tan, mockery of Jersey Shore notwithstanding. Anyway, it turns out that the yellow-skin preference is much stronger than the light-skin preference. Perhaps vegans are attractive after all, in spite of their low-protein diet and thus low-muscle body.<p></p>  However, we have to trust that the photoshop color adjustment of face photos is faithful to actual tanning and high-carotenoid skin responses.

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that fat-soluble meant you absorb it better when you have fatty acids from diet (in bloodstream? in digestive tract?). But I checked and it seems to be conventional wisdom. I thought fat-soluble only meant that you&#8217;d store it in your fat cells and thus release it when you burn fat for calories (that must be true).</p>

They found that total injury crashes fell by a significant amount in intersections that installed RLCs (estimates ranged from 13 to 29 percent).

It concluded that right-angle crashes drop by about 25 percent when RLCs are installed. However, echoing a complaint frequently made by RLC detractors, it did find that rear-end collisions increased as drivers were more likely to slam on their brakes at the sight of a red light and get hit by the following car. Thus rear-end collisions tend to rise by about 15 percent.</p> <p>However, right-angle crashes are far more dangerous and damaging than rear-enders, which explains why the study found that, on average, each RLC generated a net savings in crash costs of about $39,000 per year.</p> </blockquote> <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/16/seeing-red-why-traffic-light-cameras-are-a-good-solution-to-intersection-accidents/">HT</a><p></p>  Net savings after the cost of running the cameras.

The risk to pedestrians crossing at the time from inattentive drivers who feel free to roll-right-on-red is terrible, though.<p></p>  In general, intersections would work better if:<p></p>  1. there were pedestrian-recognition sensors (would likely have to be optical; whether active like radar, or passive like regular image recognition) that signal (especially for right-on-red turners) the presence of pedestrians. most of us have a habit of consciously checking for pedestrians at intersections, but not everyone does.<p></p>  2. there were omnidirectional indicators of time-until-next-change. you already almost get this with the time counted on don&#8217;t-walk signals (once you know an intersection).<p></p>  3. it were legal to run a red light after stopping if there are no other cars waiting (and obviously, without interfering with any moving cross traffic). many of us have done this late at night with no ill effects.<p></p>  4. car-presence sensors were more universally employed, and worked more reliably for bicycles and motorocycles (just make them properly sensitive)<p></p>  5. yellow light durations were indicated in some analog fashion (progress bar)<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 19px;">If you ever find yourself driving in Boston it has almost become customary for you to allow the first car in the turn lane to “bang a left” in front of you before you pull forward from the light.</span></span></blockquote> Not sure about that one. If that were the custom, people going straight would have to get used to a slow start (as the quote suggests). I sometimes accelerate quickly when my light turns green (but only after actually checking for red light runners and left-bangers).

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span><span>Then they claim I ignore the audience while I&#8217;m playing. Man, when I&#8217;m working, I know the people are out there. But when I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;m worrying about making my horn sound right.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span><span>And they bitch that I won&#8217;t talk to people when we go off after a set. That&#8217;s a damn lie. I talk plenty of times if everything&#8217;s going like it ought to and I feel right. But if I got my mind on something about my band or something else, well, hell, no, I don&#8217;t want to talk. When I&#8217;m working I&#8217;m concentrating. I bet you if I was a doctor sewing on some son of a bitch&#8217;s heart, they wouldn&#8217;t want me to talk.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span><span>Anybody wants to believe all this crap they hear about me, it&#8217;s their problem, not mine. Because, look, man, I like people. I<span> </span><em>love</em><span> </span>people! I&#8217;m not going around telling everybody that. I try to say that my way &#8211; with my horn. Look, when I was a boy, ten years old, I got a paper route and it got bigger than I could handle because my customers liked me so much. I just delivered papers the best I could and minded my business, the same way I play my horn now. But a lot of the people I meet now make me sick.</span></span></p>

I knew it and all the rest knew it - but all the contest first prizes went to the boys with blue eyes. It made me so mad I made up my mind to outdo anybody white on my horn. If I hadn&#8217;t met that prejudice, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have had as much drive in my work. I have thought about that a lot. I have thought that prejudice and curiosity have been responsible for what I have done in music.</span></span></blockquote>

I said if he kept getting upset with what other people think he ought to do, he never would get too far, or he sure wouldn&#8217;t last. I tried to make them see how I had worked all my life to play myself and then to get a band worth people paying to hear. I said that a lot of times when people in a club wanted to talk to me, I needed to be worrying about something about my band. They said they understood. I hope they did.</span></span></blockquote>

Yeah. It&#8217;s a lot of the Negro musicians mad because most of the best-paying jobs go to the white musicians playing what the Negroes created. But I don&#8217;t go for this, because I think prejudice one way is just as bad as the other way. I wouldn&#8217;t have no other arranger but Gil Evans &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t be much closer if he was my brother. And I remember one time when I hired Lee Konitz, some colored cats bitched a lot about me hiring an ofay in my band when Negroes didn&#8217;t have work. I said if a cat could play like Lee, I would hire him, I didn&#8217;t give a damn if he was green and had red breath.</span></span></blockquote>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I won&#8217;t play nowhere I know has the kind of audiences that you waste your breath to play for. I&#8217;m talking about them expense-account ofays that use music as a background for getting high and trying to show off to the women they brought. They ain&#8217;t come to hear good music. They don&#8217;t even know how to enjoy themselves. They drink too much, they get loud, they got to be seen and heard. They&#8217;ll jump up and dance jigs and sing. They ain&#8217;t got no manners - don&#8217;t pay their women no respect. What they really want is some Uncle Tom entertainment if it&#8217;s a Negro group on the stand. These are the kind will holler, &#8220;Hey, boy, play Sweet Georgia Brown!&#8221; You supposed to grin and play that. I hate to play in a place full of those kind of squares so bad that if there wasn&#8217;t nobody else to play to, I&#8217;d invest in some more property and just stay home and collect rents. I can&#8217;t stand dumb-ass people not respecting the other customers that have come to hear the music. Sometimes one table like that has bugged me so that when I get home or to my hotel, I walk the floor because I can&#8217;t sleep.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I told you I ain&#8217;t going to play nowhere in the South that Negroes can&#8217;t come. But I ain&#8217;t going to play nowhere in the North that Negroes don&#8217;t come. It&#8217;s one of two reasons they won&#8217;t, either because they know they ain&#8217;t wanted, or because they don&#8217;t like the joint&#8217;s regular run of music. Negroes ain&#8217;t got as much money to throw away in nightclubs as white people. So a club that Negroes patronize, you can figure that everybody that goes there comes expecting to hear good music.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span> </span>I grew up with an allowance, and I had a big newspaper route. I saved most of what I made except for buying records. But when I first left home as a musician, I used to spend all I made, and when I went on dope, I got in debt. But after I got enough sense to kick the habit, I started to make more than I needed to spend unless I was crazy or something.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now I got a pretty good portfolio of stock investments, and I got this house - it&#8217;s worth into six figures, including everything in it. My four kids are coming up fine. When the boys get in from school, I want you to see them working out on the bags in our gym downstairs. I keep myself in shape and teach the kids how to box. They can handle themselves. Ain&#8217;t nothing better that a father can pass along. Then I got my music, I got Frances, and my Ferrari - and our friends. I got everything a man could want - if it just wasn&#8217;t for this prejudice crap. It ain&#8217;t that I&#8217;m mad at white people, I just see what I see and I know what&#8217;s happening. I am going to speak my mind about anything that drags me about this Jim Crow scene. This whole prejudice mess is something you would feel so good if it could just be got rid of, like a big sore eating inside of your belly.</p>
