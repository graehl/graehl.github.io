			High Protein:calorie Ratio Feed Makes Insects Die Early</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v1/n10/full/100098.html">Study</a>:</p>
<p></p>  (sadly: of insects, not humans. humans take too long to die?)<p></p>  Most animals will keep eating until they have enough protein. In some insects, they&#8217;ll eat up to the level that shortens their lifespan but increases their reproductive output.<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>increasing the ratio of protein and non-protein energy in the diet decreases lifespan</strong>; but as seen in the example from male crickets discussed above, if this ratio falls too far there is an increased risk of decreased longevity associated with obesity</span></blockquote>
<p>uh-oh. i like my high-protein diet. i need muscles to do well in soccer and volleyball. and it&#8217;s easy not to overeat when you&#8217;re not craving protein. this suggests a benefit from titrating protein somehow (being sensitive to how much of it you need for your activity level).</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">protein intake is more strongly regulated than that of carbohydrate and fat [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v1/n10/full/100098.html#bibl_20" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; color: #4074c8;">20</a>]. As a result, protein appetite drives overconsumption of energy on low percent protein diets, promoting obesity and metabolic disorders with consequent effects on longevity</span></blockquote>
<p>so, be skinny, on as little protein as you can get away with (obviously you&#8217;ll die with 0 protein in your diet; likewise with 0 fat).</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana,arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 16px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">the major causes of increased longevity in studies on calorically restricted primates (most recently [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v1/n10/full/100098.html#bibl_30" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; color: #4074c8;">30</a>]) is a reduction in the incidence of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease relative to ad libitum fed controls. This may not result from benefits associated with CR per se, but rather reflect the costs of nutrient imbalance when feeding ad libitum on a fixed diet. As the required balance of nutrients changes over time (with time of day, season, growth and development, and senescence), animals will be forced to overeat some nutrients to gain enough of others</span></blockquote>
<p>speculation without evidence - they seem to be suggesting that ideally you eat the minimum amount of food necessary for all vitamin / macronutrient needs. but it&#8217;s also true that if you have excess body fat, you&#8217;ll survive surgery better. some excess makes you more robust. we can&#8217;t really titrate perfectly.</p>
<p></p>  i suppose the overall question would be: how much quality of life do you have to sacrifice by risking insufficient intake of various nutrients, in order to maybe live longer? nobody knows the answer for humans, yet.<p></p>

<p>yes, perhaps. i hope not, but it needs to be studied - how sensitive is the curve? how &#8220;too much&#8221; can you do while barely reducing lifespan?</p>

		      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid">Phytic acid isn&#8217;t well understood</a> (at least, its impact on human health isn&#8217;t), but it&#8217;s definitely found in many nuts and grains (white flour and rice have far less of it; it&#8217;s mostly in the hulls/bran), and is good at removing minerals (by chelation) from the human body, e.g. zinc and iron, which is generally bad. On the other hand, it&#8217;s nice for removing uranium from the body. It also reduces colon cancer. It penetrates the brain and can protect neurons there by chelating iron (which I guess you don&#8217;t want in the brain - iron does get in there somehow and exacerbates many brain diseases).<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Grain consumption has long been known to damage vitamin D status and bone health. Indeed, it is difficult to induce bone frailty in laboratory animals without feeding them grain. In Edward Mellanby’s original experiments leading to the discovery of vitamin D, he induced rickets by feeding dogs a diet of oats or wheat bread. [3] In human infants, wheat bran induces rickets. [4] In addition to interfering with vitamin D, grains also contain high levels of <b>phytic acid, which interferes with bone mineralization by blocking absorption of calcium and magnesium.</b></span></blockquote> <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=119">source</a> (while making fun of Gwyneth Paltrow&#8217;s ridiculous macrobiotic diet)<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Another crucial factor in bone health is vitamin K2.

Almonds and sesame seeds are very high in it; toasting them might help.<p></p>  It seems like you can benefit from moderate phytic acid (nullifying iron in your brain sounds good), by simply ensuring you have excess of the minerals it chelates and steals from you.

			Fish Oil (EPA+DHA) Rocks, but Promote Kidney Stones, Cancer, and Obesity (With Fructose); Unsat. Vegetable Oil, and Wheat Are Bad</a>

<p></p>  You need DHA in your diet (EPA can be synthesized from ALA, which is in flaxseed oil; DHA barely can). But high levels of polyunsaturated fats may be dangerous; they&#8217;re easily oxidized (anecdotal evidence; natural diets don&#8217;t have high levels, unless they&#8217;re mostly fish):<p></p>  You can supplement DHA from some particular type of seaweed (I forget the details), or in many fatty fish or their extracted oil (watch your mercury). It does occur naturally in lesser quantities in various other foods. DHA lowers testosterone, but it has many good effects. Lower testosterone means more (harmless, operable) prostate cancer, but possibly more frequent severe cases:<p></p>

Another reason to eat a high-fat diet.</span></blockquote>
<p>(the ratio matters; eat more saturated fat to mitigate the harms while still getting some of the benefits of DHA)</p>
<p></p> 
<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">
</span><p>Most Americans eat far too much omega-6, and their omega-6 to omega-3 tissue ratio is too high, which is pro-inflammatory via the COX-2 pathway. Eating omega-3s including DHA reduces inflammation by downregulating the COX-2 pathway. This accounts for the well-attested benefits of DHA against cardiovascular disease. Now, cancer is promoted by COX-2 pathway inflammation, which is why COX-2 inhibitors such as aspirin and ibuprofen are protective against cancer. [4] DHA’s action to downregulate this pathway must generate an anti-cancer effect. But, unlike aspirin and ibuprofen, DHA has no observable effect on overall cancer risk. This suggests that<span> </span><strong><em>DHA has other effects, unrelated to its anti-inflammatory activity, that are cancer promoting</em></strong>. These counterbalance the benefits from its anti-inflammatory effect. If DHA has pro-angiogenic effects that are independent of COX-2 mediated inflammation, then this could account for the observations.</p>
<p>One reason an association of DHA with high-grade cancer may have been missed is that it would be detected only in large studies able to segregate cancers by grade.</p>

<blockquote><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"><span> </span>a person in whom the immune system is trying but failing to clear elevated CEP levels almost invariably has macular degeneration (AMD)</span></blockquote>
<p>AMD = why 1/3 of people 75+ yr old are nearly blind. DHA is the only cause of CEP. It&#8217;s caused by excessive growth of blood vessels dislodging the retina. DHA is concentrated near the retina (is 80% of the PUFA in it). Photons cause oxidation, and DHA is extremely oxidizable. Antioxidants help slow AMD. Finally, adding CEP directly to mice causes AMD (this was shown in 2003). (we know now it&#8217;s because CEP causes angiogensis).</p>
<p></p>  CEP is normally good. It brings immune cells from bone marrow to the wound. Cancers and AMD give chronic CEP elevation. CEP actually causes wound healing even in mice with normal wound healing mechanisms crippled (VEGF and TLR2 knocked-out or inhibited) - this was shown in 2010. VEGF causes angiogenesis when tissue is oxygen deprived. TLR2 causes angiogenesis when it detects oxidative stress.<p></p>  vitamin A + DHA yield CEP (via retinyl from A + HOHA=oxidized DHA).<p></p>  If you&#8217;re going to take DHA (usually fish oil) you&#8217;ll want anti-oxidants. Oxidation can&#8217;t be avoided; it&#8217;s essential to metabolism and fighting infection.<p></p> 
<blockquote><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;">At the moment, I think it’s prudent to eat no more than 1 pound of salmon or similar cold-water fish per week, to avoid further EPA/DHA supplements, and to avoid low-fat diets which tend to elevate membrane DHA levels. Moderate omega-3 consumption is especially important for those suffering from diseases of pathological angiogenesis – especially cancer. DHA is essential for good health – but in excess, it is probably dangerous.</span></blockquote>

</span><p>This recipe is invoked normally and properly during wound healing. But it is also invoked excessively in pathological contexts – notably in cancers and age-related macular degeneration, probably also in other angiogenesis-associated diseases such as arthritis, rosacea, obesity, psoriasis, endometriosis, dementia, and multiple sclerosis.</p>

</span><p><span> </span>Finasteride raises DHA levels, and DHA lowers testosterone. Low testosterone reduces incidence of low-grade prostate cancers but makes it much more likely they will progress to high-grade.

</span><p><span> </span>Observational studies weakly link high DHA, high vitamin A, and low antioxidant status to diseases of angiogenesis such as cancer.</p>
<p>This pattern would be consistent with the idea that the natural pathway used in wound healing to trigger angiogenesis – DHA oxidation and combination with retinyl protein to trigger TLR-2 pathways – is also important for cancer progression.</p>
<p>It suggests a strategy of reduced fish oil and vitamin A consumption and increased intake of certain antioxidants (such as lycopene, zinc, selenium, or NAC) may be helpful against cancer.</p>
<p>However, this idea needs testing. No study in animal cancer models has tested this dietary combination.</p>
<p>Given the many proven benefits of moderate amounts of fish oil, I don’t see a reason yet to alter our recommendation that healthy people should eat a pound of fish per week. That said, I do think very high intakes of fish or fish oil are ill advised. And I’m intrigued by the idea that dietary changes may have the potential to play a powerful role in recovery from diseases of angiogenesis such as cancer.</p>

This made big difference for about 3 months, then seemed to not work any more. I talked to a nutritionist friend and she pointed out that according to Andrew Stoll (The Omega 3 Connection) you must take 1000 mg vit C and 500 iu vit E daily or the omega 3 becomes oxidised in your body (cell membranes) and ineffective. I started taking both and in days was back to the original anti-inflammatory effectiveness of omega 3. I have since talked to others about this – for example a psychiatrist whose clients did well on omega 3 for 3 months and then it became ineffective.</span></blockquote>
<p>quite anecdotal - needs actual research. but the fact that omega-3 are easily oxidized means they might degrade vit-C (which means you need enough carbs+selenium in your diet to move the DHAA out of the bloodstream into cells for reconversion to C, or you just need to bear the harm of DHAA and supplement more C. In general, vit E supplementation is quite harmful. I wouldn&#8217;t do it unless strong evidence revealed that it&#8217;s okay when you have high omega-3 intake.</p>

		      There isn&#8217;t an obvious minimum required amount of carbs in the human diet.<p></p>  However, a diet too low in carb+protein calories is definitely bad. <p></p>  Further, when fighting infection, it&#8217;s tricky to give your body what it needs if you&#8217;re not getting enough carbs. Without enough (protein or carbs) you won&#8217;t get the insulin needed to recycle oxidized vitamin c produced when fighting infection (you can supplement C, but the unrecycled oxidized byproduct is itself harmful). If you must have a near-0-carb diet, you should supplement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine">NAC</a>, selenium, zinc, copper, coenzyme Q10, ALA, and colorful veggies/berries, especially if fighting infection.<p></p>  It&#8217;s almost impossible to make animals carb-deficient; they have large livers (which manufacture glucose) relative to their small brains&#8217; glucose needs.<p></p>  Glucose is needed for immune function and mucus. <p></p>  If your mucus is low enough, you&#8217;ll get far more constipation and gut cancers, as do people who&#8217;ve followed the &#8220;Optimal Diet&#8221; popular in Poland. The reason ulcers and stomach cancers are greatly increased with Helicobacter pylori bacterial infection is that the stomach mucus is severely reduced:<p></p>  You&#8217;ll get 100x more kidney stones on an extremely low-carb diet unless you specifically mitigate several factors.<p></p>  If you&#8217;re mucus-deficient enough, you&#8217;ll have dry, bloodshot eyes and dry mouth. If that happens, you definitely need more glucose (meaning more protein possibly, but the simplest solution is to add slightly more carbs). White rice is a safe source of carbs.<p></p>  source: <a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=1032">http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=1032</a><p></p>  <blockquote type="cite">

However, when ascorbate is used in massive amounts, such as 30-200+ g per 24 h, these amounts directly provide the electrons necessary to quench the free radicals of almost any inflammation. Additionally, in high concentrations ascorbate reduces NAD(P)H and therefore can provide the high-energy electrons necessary to reduce the molecular oxygen used in the respiratory burst of phagocytes. In these functions, the ascorbate part is mostly wasted but the necessary high-energy electrons are provided in large amounts.</span></blockquote> I guess my speculation above is right.<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Another early view was that vitamin C helps by destroying histamine, which may be produced in excess under conditions of stress.</span></blockquote> &#8220;early view&#8221;? sounds like it&#8217;s not a good view :)<br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">the oxidized form of vitamin C, dehydroascorbate, has strong antiviral activity in vitro.</span></blockquote> DHAA is the (harmful) used vit-C byproduct that&#8217;s normally recycled. <br> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>in clinical experience, vitamin C is most effective against viral infections.</span></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Since animals upregulate ascorbate production under all kinds of stress, not just viral infections, it seems probable that vitamin C aids health by multiple pathways, not only by antiviral activity.</span></blockquote> <blockquote type="cite"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; text-indent: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Vitamin C is extremely safe.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ignoring the superstitious pseudo-evolutionary constellation of beliefs associated with it, I think &#8220;paleo&#8221; believers are doing a good job noticing severe flaws in conventional diet and health advice. The main dietary themes seem to me: plenty of protein is good, saturated animal fat is good, non-contaminated fish are good, colorful vegetables are good, high carbs (as far as it causes high insulin or appetite) is bad, fructose is bad (oddly, they usually recommend fruits anyway, especially berries), nuts+avocados are good, grains are bad (they&#8217;re divided on that; some people legitimately suffer from grains - tubers/squashes instead), full-fat and/or fermented dairy is better than low-fat (also divided; over half the world is lactose intolerant, so non-fermented dairy would be a bad idea for them), and, in terms of supplementation: plenty of DHA (fish oil) and vitamin D (sunlight or pills), otherwise RDA plus a little.</p>
<p></p>

Probably healthy enough but it won&#8217;t support intense physical activity.<p></p>  Some smart folks have noticed that you have at least initial success with low-food-reward calorie consumption (basically: don&#8217;t combine a source of calories with something that&#8217;s fun to eat). e.g. <a href="http://www.sethroberts.net/">Seth Roberts</a><p></p>  This guy dissents:

<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px 1em;">I think our evolved preference for tasty foods including starches, fat, salt, and other “high reward” flavors indicates they are healthy, and therefore that a diet rich in such foods is most likely to cure metabolic damage.</li>
<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px 1em;">I think it is essential to stay away from toxic, malnourishing foods made from wheat, fructose sugars, omega-6 oils, and bioactive compounds like MSG; and instead to eat foods that accord with our evolutionary history.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By metabolic damage, he means one of many possible things that can go wrong, with fat cells, the brain, hormones, whatever (really yet to be completely discovered). He objects to focusing on food-reward because he thinks that the fact that low-reward diets&#8217; initial effectiveness is almost never sustained. By the way, the concept of &#8220;metabolic damage&#8221; being responsible for obesity is controversial amongst the &#8220;fat people have no willpower&#8221; crowd, but clearly diabetes fits the description.</p>
<p></p>  Don&#8217;t supplement with too much calcium. Not only does high calcium prevent bone turnover (which you want), but it prevents magnesium absorption (oddly enough, supplementing magnesium will also help calcium reach bones).

<p>I started to get a little body acne after supplementing with 4000 IU D daily (especially once I started getting an hour of sun daily). I figured that was due to excess D (it&#8217;s fat soluble and so a dose that was fine for a few weeks may be too much once you&#8217;re saturated) but perhaps it was just giving me steroid-like side effects :) In any case, I cut back on the D supplementation (you can&#8217;t get too much D from sun, fortunately - the body scales back when it&#8217;s not needed).</p>

<p></p>  Conventional wisdom aside, it&#8217;s generally thought that people universally prefer lighter skin and (lesser known) yellower skin, which is a sign of high carotenoids, which are a sign for (cause of, probably) a healthier immune system. So it would make sense that people instinctively prefer yellower skin. Perhaps the fake orange tan is more attractive than a real tan, mockery of Jersey Shore notwithstanding. Anyway, it turns out that the yellow-skin preference is much stronger than the light-skin preference. Perhaps vegans are attractive after all, in spite of their low-protein diet and thus low-muscle body.<p></p>  However, we have to trust that the photoshop color adjustment of face photos is faithful to actual tanning and high-carotenoid skin responses.

<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that fat-soluble meant you absorb it better when you have fatty acids from diet (in bloodstream? in digestive tract?). But I checked and it seems to be conventional wisdom. I thought fat-soluble only meant that you&#8217;d store it in your fat cells and thus release it when you burn fat for calories (that must be true).</p>

They found that total injury crashes fell by a significant amount in intersections that installed RLCs (estimates ranged from 13 to 29 percent). The reduction in total crashes was smaller for reasons I’m about to discuss, but it ranged from 7 to 26 percent. They concluded that RLCs reduce total casualties, though the reductions in total collisions are more modest. <p><a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/05048/05048.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(34, 68, 187);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another study</span></a>, this one from the Federal Highway Association, also found overall safety benefits. It concluded that right-angle crashes drop by about 25 percent when RLCs are installed. However, echoing a complaint frequently made by RLC detractors, it did find that rear-end collisions increased as drivers were more likely to slam on their brakes at the sight of a red light and get hit by the following car. Thus rear-end collisions tend to rise by about 15 percent.</p> <p>However, right-angle crashes are far more dangerous and damaging than rear-enders, which explains why the study found that, on average, each RLC generated a net savings in crash costs of about $39,000 per year.</p> </blockquote> <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/16/seeing-red-why-traffic-light-cameras-are-a-good-solution-to-intersection-accidents/">HT</a><p></p>  Net savings after the cost of running the cameras. I wonder what the cost is, if any, in increased commute time.<p></p>  I do think that rolling right-on-red should be allowed (not punished by RLC). The risk to pedestrians crossing at the time from inattentive drivers who feel free to roll-right-on-red is terrible, though.<p></p>  In general, intersections would work better if:<p></p>  1. there were pedestrian-recognition sensors (would likely have to be optical; whether active like radar, or passive like regular image recognition) that signal (especially for right-on-red turners) the presence of pedestrians. most of us have a habit of consciously checking for pedestrians at intersections, but not everyone does.<p></p>  2. there were omnidirectional indicators of time-until-next-change. you already almost get this with the time counted on don&#8217;t-walk signals (once you know an intersection).<p></p>  3. it were legal to run a red light after stopping if there are no other cars waiting (and obviously, without interfering with any moving cross traffic). many of us have done this late at night with no ill effects.<p></p>  4. car-presence sensors were more universally employed, and worked more reliably for bicycles and motorocycles (just make them properly sensitive)<p></p>  5. yellow light durations were indicated in some analog fashion (progress bar)<p></p>  <blockquote type="cite"><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 19px;">If you ever find yourself driving in Boston it has almost become customary for you to allow the first car in the turn lane to “bang a left” in front of you before you pull forward from the light.</span></span></blockquote> Not sure about that one. If that were the custom, people going straight would have to get used to a slow start (as the quote suggests). I sometimes accelerate quickly when my light turns green (but only after actually checking for red light runners and left-bangers).

They don&#8217;t even know how to enjoy themselves. They drink too much, they get loud, they got to be seen and heard. They&#8217;ll jump up and dance jigs and sing. They ain&#8217;t got no manners - don&#8217;t pay their women no respect. What they really want is some Uncle Tom entertainment if it&#8217;s a Negro group on the stand. These are the kind will holler, &#8220;Hey, boy, play Sweet Georgia Brown!&#8221; You supposed to grin and play that. I hate to play in a place full of those kind of squares so bad that if there wasn&#8217;t nobody else to play to, I&#8217;d invest in some more property and just stay home and collect rents. I can&#8217;t stand dumb-ass people not respecting the other customers that have come to hear the music.

But I ain&#8217;t going to play nowhere in the North that Negroes don&#8217;t come. It&#8217;s one of two reasons they won&#8217;t, either because they know they ain&#8217;t wanted, or because they don&#8217;t like the joint&#8217;s regular run of music. Negroes ain&#8217;t got as much money to throw away in nightclubs as white people. So a club that Negroes patronize, you can figure that everybody that goes there comes expecting to hear good music.</p>

Some of the subjects were instructed to eat radishes and resist the sweets, and afterwards all were put to work on unsolvable geometric puzzles. Resisting the sweets, independent of mood, made participants give up more than twice as quickly on the geometric puzzles. Resisting temptation, the researchers found, seemed to have “produced a ‘psychic cost.’”</span></span></blockquote>
<p><br>Based on the reporter&#8217;s description, I expected that the chocolate eaters merely tried harder because of the caffeine and sugar (both of which are known to help motivate or support mental labor).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the actual  study was careful of this (see <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Baumeister%20et%20al.%20%281998%29.pdf">pg 1254, Method</a>, and Table 1); a no-food no-temptation control group performed the same as the chocolate-indulging group. It was only the radish-eating chocolate-resisters (giving up 40% sooner due to the psychic pain of resisting a fresh-baked-chocolate-chip-cookie temptation).</p>

To date, the hypothesis of seasonal variation in sleep has not been tested in a large population-based fully blinded study. The aim of the current study was to investigate monthly variations in sleep problems in a geographic region of Norway with large seasonal differences in daytime light. Using data from a general health survey, the authors had access to information on sleep in the general population, collected across the seasons over 2 years without linking sleep to seasonal variation. In all, 43,045 participants (mean age, 44.6 years) of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study, 1995–1997 (referred to as “HUNT-2”), provided reports of insomnia symptoms and time in bed in all months except July. The mean prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 12.4%. No evidence of a seasonal variation on reports of insomnia symptoms or time in bed was found. These null findings are in marked contrast to previous seasonality studies of sleep. Previous studies reporting seasonal variations in sleep and insomnia might have been subject to publication biases and lack of blinding to the research hypothesis.</blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">SAD</a> doesn&#8217;t exist. But if you can&#8217;t find seasonal sleep variation in 40,000 people, it probably doesn&#8217;t exist. If prolonged sunlight during long extreme-north summer days makes it harder to sleep normally, then people must have adjusted (e.g. blinds that actually block the light).</p>

The research relates the concept of high mind development to the potential to become really good at something:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>New research shows that musicians’ brains are highly developed in a way that makes the musicians alert, interested in learning, disposed to see the whole picture, calm, and playful. The same traits have previously been found among world-class athletes, top-level managers, and individuals who practice transcendental meditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using<span> </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography" target="_blank" style="color: #2244bb;">EEG</a>‘s to measure brain activity, researchers concluded the following about the brains of musicians:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>They have well-coordinated frontal lobes. Our frontal lobes are what we use for higher brain functions, such as planning and logical thinking. Another characteristic is that activity at a certain frequency, so-called alpha waves, dominates. Alpha waves occur when the brain puts together details into wholes. Yet another EEG measure shows that individuals with high mind brain development use their brain resources economically. They are alert and ready for action when it is functional to be so, but they are relaxed and adopt a wait-and-see attitude when that is functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Musicians also exhibited higher levels of moral reasoning and had more frequent “peak experiences”– intense moments of happiness and feelings of transcending limitations.</p>
</span></span>(via <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com">Frakonomics</a>)<p></p>  Probably the same can be found in anyone who tries hard to do well at a complex task e.g. acting or mathematics (which isn&#8217;t to say that certain facilities aren&#8217;t unique in music or sport or politicking, as opposed to purely intellectual pursuits).

<p><br> First, read the graph (bigger bar = more error). The second guess is worse than the first. But the average is better.</p>
<p></p>  It&#8217;s well known that the average of several experts&#8217; estimates is more reliable than a randomly selected expert&#8217;s.<p></p>  I&#8217;m skeptical about the 3-week delay; if just a few subjects sought out information about the question on the web, then that could explain the difference. However, it makes sense that the first estimate probably anchors the second with immediate re-guessing. Probably the weeks-delayed re-guess is indeed superior even if the person isn&#8217;t exposed to new information in the interim.<p></p>  I&#8217;d like to compare the average of two quick guesses with one well-considered guess (similar energy expenditure).<p></p>  (via <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com">rjlipton</a>)<p></p>  p.s. don&#8217;t use bar graphs if the origin isn&#8217;t 0; it&#8217;s misleading

<p></p>  This <a href="http://www.nature.com/oby/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/oby201164a.pdf">new study</a> (via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/weekinreview/01kolata.html">NY Times</a>) shows that within a year of liposuction, women regained all the weight and fat cells, but distributed elsewhere, since liposuction destroys the substrate under the skin on which fat cells grow.<p></p>  Background knowledge: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipocyte">fat cells</a> produce hormones that affect hunger and metabolism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistin">resisitin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin">adiponectin</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin">leptin</a>). A depleted fat cell &#8220;wants&#8221; to be filled. Excessively fat people often end up with diabetes and heart failure. They also really experience more physical hunger.<p></p>  I have 70% belief in the following: if you overfill your fat cells, then the total number of fat cells increases (more or less permanently; they are replaced one for one as they die off). If you boost your peak number of fat cells, you will always have that peak number when you lose weight; they&#8217;ll just be emptier and causing you more hunger.<p></p>  Tendencies to &#8220;put on weight&#8221; first in one location or another are at least partly due to the larger number of fat cells there.<p></p>  A new theory proposed by the study authors (I don&#8217;t believe the evidence proves it yet): the body has some homeostasis in terms of the number of fat cells - if you destroy fat cells, it will add more (other than you&#8217;d expect from overeating so that existing fat cells are full). If this is true, they should be able to find something produced by each fat cell that doesn&#8217;t depend on its fullness (as well as the mechanism regulating fat cells birth as a function of that signal). I think this because if the same intensity of hormonal signaling can be caused e.g. by 2 full fat cells as 1 empty one then the liposucked women would be able to avoid growth of new fat cells by leaving those cells empty (which would require a change in their diet). In other words, I&#8217;m not sure how the authors ruled out the obvious explanation that the previously fat women continued overeating after the liposuction.<p></p>  It is interesting at least, to know for sure that there&#8217;s not much obstacle to putting on a ton of fat anywhere and everywhere - that it&#8217;s probably not much harder to add 30lbs of fat to just the upper body (assuming full-lower-body-liposuction) than it is to add 30lbs distributed evenly (no liposuction).

But it sure is possible and fun to imagine. How many intelligent alien species are there, ever existing or now existing? Fun to consider, especially since the answer to both questions could possibly be zero, but not necessarily fewer than billions (even though we haven&#8217;t yet found a single one).
<p>Also, it&#8217;s hard to predict whether sending obvious signals of our existence and nature at lightspeed will yield good or bad results if and when we&#8217;re contacted by aliens. But I&#8217;m inclined to believe that, even though we don&#8217;t have the ability to hide completely, we should try to hide. This means at least making our wireless data signals look like constant noise (something that happens automatically if you&#8217;re trying to maximize signal bandwidth given limited EM spectrum). There&#8217;s definitely nothing wrong with listening in case any other species was so bold as to not hide.</p>
