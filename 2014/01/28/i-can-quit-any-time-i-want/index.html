<p>Studies that quantify the discomfort or annoyance people feel at performing unpleasant tasks suggest that at some point people have just had it &hellip; their &ldquo;willpower&rdquo; is &ldquo;depleted&rdquo;. Or maybe they just want to do something else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to find useful things that I can really want to do. If I had that, then loss of willpower would just mean that I&rsquo;m exploring more and grinding less.</p>

<blockquote><p>Initial acts of control lead to shifts in motivation away from “have-to” or “ought-to” goals and toward “want-to” goals. “Have-to” tasks are carried out through a sense of duty or contractual obligation, while “want-to” tasks are carried out because they are personally enjoyable and meaningful; as such, “want-to” tasks feel easy to perform and to maintain in focal attention. The distinction between “have-to” and “want-to,” however, is not always clear cut, with some “want-to” goals (e.g., wanting to lose weight) being more introjected and feeling more like “have-to” goals because they are adopted out of a sense of duty, societal conformity, or guilt instead of anticipated pleasure.</p><p>According to decades of research on self-determination theory, the quality of motivation that people apply to a situation ranges from extrinsic motivation, whereby behavior is performed because of external demand or reward, to intrinsic motivation, whereby behavior is performed because it is inherently enjoyable and rewarding. Thus, when we suggest that depletion leads to a shift from “have-to” to “want-to” goals, we are suggesting that prior acts of cognitive effort lead people to prefer activities that they deem enjoyable or gratifying over activities that they feel they ought to do because it corresponds to some external pressure or introjected goal. For example, after initial cognitive exertion, restrained eaters prefer to indulge their sweet tooth rather than adhere to their strict views of what is appropriate to eat. Crucially, this shift from “have-to” to “want-to” can be offset when people become (internally or externally) motivated to perform a “have-to” task. Thus, it is not that people cannot control themselves on some externally mandated task (e.g., name colors, do not read words); it is that they do not feel like controlling themselves, preferring to indulge instead in more inherently enjoyable and easier pursuits (e.g., read words). Like fatigue, the effect is driven by reluctance and not incapability.</p><p>Research is consistent with this motivational viewpoint. Although working hard at Time 1 tends to lead to less control on “have-to” tasks at Time 2, this effect is attenuated when participants are motivated to perform the Time 2 task, personally invested in the Time 2 task, or when they enjoy the Time 1 task. Similarly, although performance tends to falter after continuously performing a task for a long period, it returns to baseline when participants are rewarded for their efforts; and remains stable for participants who have some control over and are thus engaged with the task. Motivation, in short, moderates depletion. We suggest that changes in task motivation also mediate depletion.</p><p>Depletion, however, is not simply less motivation overall. Rather, it is produced by lower motivation to engage in “have-to” tasks, yet higher motivation to engage in “want-to” tasks. Depletion stokes desire. Thus, working hard at Time 1 increases approach motivation, as indexed by self-reported states, impulsive responding, and sensitivity to inherently-rewarding, appetitive stimuli. This shift in motivational priorities from “have-to” to “want-to” means that depletion can increase the reward value of inherently-rewarding stimuli. For example, when depleted dieters see food cues, they show more activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a brain area associated with coding reward value, compared to non-depleted dieters.</p><footer><strong>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/12/Inzlicht-Schmeichel-Macrae-in-press.pdf'>Why Self-Control Seems (but May Not Be) Limited</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
