	<div class="entry-content"><p>I liked John Medina&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Principles-Surviving-Thriving/dp/0979777747/">Brain Rules</a>, and my sister just had a baby, so I skimmed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Rules-Baby-Raise-Smart/dp/0983263302/">Brain Rules for Baby</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<div>Unlike his other work, a lot of these recommendations aren&#8217;t sourced by research (some are, but the detailed experimental description isn&#8217;t always there):</div>
<p></p>
<div>(pre-birth) Mom should take folic acid around conception, and throughout (including breast-feeding) get omega-3 (best source: fish - just avoid mercury from high-in-foodchain tuna, mackerel, swordfish, etc.), gain the right amount of weight (300 extra cal/day), get the right amount of exercise (30 min walking, don&#8217;t overheat!), and be protected from extreme stress (or unpreventable chronic stress - figure out some way to feel in control of what&#8217;s bothering you). An 8 pound birth weight vs. a 6 or 9 pound weight is on average 1 IQ point (negligible). </div>
<p></p>
<div>How smart a baby is predicts IQ at age 18.</div>
<p></p>
<div>No fighting, mom and dad. Seriously. If a baby has high stress markers in its blood, the parents are probably fighting and will probably split (causality is probably reverse - fighting harms baby). In order to avoid fighting, try dealing with someone&#8217;s complaints with 1. describe the emotion you think you&#8217;re seeing 2. guess what&#8217;s causing it (out loud). People like to feel understood. If you guess wrong, they still feel you care. Sleep loss is no joke - try to share the load and get both parents enough rest. Have sex.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Reconcile in front of kids if you fought in front of them.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Tapes of foreign language do nothing for a baby. Social interaction is needed to cause language acquisition.</div>
<p></p>
<div>American Sign Language lessons for first graders improved their IQ test scores. You could try some form of sign language with your kid.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Breast feed (+8 IQ). At least a year. Formula pushers are evil. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Talk to your toddler, using a variety of words, in actual interactions. Reward with extra attention. Face to face. They imitate you; you, them.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Demonstrate. Speculate at motives for others&#8217; behaviors - teaches kids to model others.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Slowed, melodic speech, and higher pitch, actually helps babies imitate/learn.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Dramatic pretend play with a partner is good.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Play with your kid. Opposite day (call things by their opposite). Imitation games. Don&#8217;t push if they&#8217;re tired/overstimulated.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Praise trying (&#8220;you worked hard on that!&#8221;), not being &#8220;smart&#8221;. If you praise for being &#8220;X&#8221;, they spend time worrying about how to preserve their image as &#8220;X&#8221;. </div>
<p></p>
<div>No TV or &#8220;baby Einstein&#8221; for the first 2 years. The right kind and amount of movies/video games for the rest of life may be fine or even useful.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Get your kids exercising. Don&#8217;t feed them stuff that they become self-guided pleasure-overeaters of.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Help kids learn to dwell on what makes them grateful. Teach forgiveness of loved ones, and rewarding sharing of experiences (storytelling).</div>
<p></p>
<div>Make sure your kid has good friends. Or just has friends at all.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Demanding parents (that is, not controlling everything in the kid&#8217;s life, but explaining what&#8217;s actually required) who pay attention and respond to their kid&#8217;s emotions are the best. Parents should seem to notice and care about what the kid does.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Don&#8217;t punish/repress emotions per se - including in yourself. Behavior can be chosen, not emotions. Teach about what the emotion is. Teach about what behavior may help. Don&#8217;t try to band-aid (sad? ice cream! new toy!) a feeling, or give useless &#8220;toughen up&#8221; advice.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If your kid feels crowded, don&#8217;t crowd.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Describe your kid&#8217;s emotions, guess out loud at what&#8217;s causing them. Listen. Labeling helps communication and self-understanding. Describe your own emotions out loud (optionally - silent is fine too).</div>
<p></p>
<div>10 years of music lessons starting before age 7 - might help them pick up tone tells in verbal communications. Might have other benefits.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Use a crisis to teach: empathy first to calm. Express wanting to help.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Explain rules (give reason - bad consequence to be avoided); punish swiftly, but without making the child fear for safety. Praise for following rules. Praise for absence of rule-violation.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Don&#8217;t spank - let them suffer the natural consequences then offer succor, or remove a privilege/toy. Don&#8217;t punish with &#8220;I don&#8217;t like you&#8221; disapproval.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Watch videotape of yourself doing your usual parenting thing.</div>
