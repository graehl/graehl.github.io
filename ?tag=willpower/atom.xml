<p>Studies that quantify the discomfort or annoyance people feel at performing unpleasant tasks suggest that at some point people have just had it &hellip; their &ldquo;willpower&rdquo; is &ldquo;depleted&rdquo;. Or maybe they just want to do something else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to find useful things that I can really want to do. If I had that, then loss of willpower would just mean that I&rsquo;m exploring more and grinding less.</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Initial acts of control lead to shifts in motivation away from “have-to” or “ought-to” goals and toward “want-to” goals. “Have-to” tasks are carried out through a sense of duty or contractual obligation, while “want-to” tasks are carried out because they are personally enjoyable and meaningful; as such, “want-to” tasks feel easy to perform and to maintain in focal attention. The distinction between “have-to” and “want-to,” however, is not always clear cut, with some “want-to” goals (e.g., wanting to lose weight) being more introjected and feeling more like “have-to” goals because they are adopted out of a sense of duty, societal conformity, or guilt instead of anticipated pleasure.</p></p><p><p>According to decades of research on self-determination theory, the quality of motivation that people apply to a situation ranges from extrinsic motivation, whereby behavior is performed because of external demand or reward, to intrinsic motivation, whereby behavior is performed because it is inherently enjoyable and rewarding. Thus, when we suggest that depletion leads to a shift from “have-to” to “want-to” goals, we are suggesting that prior acts of cognitive effort lead people to prefer activities that they deem enjoyable or gratifying over activities that they feel they ought to do because it corresponds to some external pressure or introjected goal. For example, after initial cognitive exertion, restrained eaters prefer to indulge their sweet tooth rather than adhere to their strict views of what is appropriate to eat. Crucially, this shift from “have-to” to “want-to” can be offset when people become (internally or externally) motivated to perform a “have-to” task. Thus, it is not that people cannot control themselves on some externally mandated task (e.g., name colors, do not read words); it is that they do not feel like controlling themselves, preferring to indulge instead in more inherently enjoyable and easier pursuits (e.g., read words). Like fatigue, the effect is driven by reluctance and not incapability.</p></p><p><p>Research is consistent with this motivational viewpoint. Although working hard at Time 1 tends to lead to less control on “have-to” tasks at Time 2, this effect is attenuated when participants are motivated to perform the Time 2 task, personally invested in the Time 2 task, or when they enjoy the Time 1 task. Similarly, although performance tends to falter after continuously performing a task for a long period, it returns to baseline when participants are rewarded for their efforts; and remains stable for participants who have some control over and are thus engaged with the task. Motivation, in short, moderates depletion. We suggest that changes in task motivation also mediate depletion.</p></p><p><p>Depletion, however, is not simply less motivation overall. Rather, it is produced by lower motivation to engage in “have-to” tasks, yet higher motivation to engage in “want-to” tasks. Depletion stokes desire. Thus, working hard at Time 1 increases approach motivation, as indexed by self-reported states, impulsive responding, and sensitivity to inherently-rewarding, appetitive stimuli. This shift in motivational priorities from “have-to” to “want-to” means that depletion can increase the reward value of inherently-rewarding stimuli. For example, when depleted dieters see food cues, they show more activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a brain area associated with coding reward value, compared to non-depleted dieters.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Trends in Cognitive Sciences <a href="http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/12/Inzlicht-Schmeichel-Macrae-in-press.pdf">http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/12/Inzlicht-Schmeichel-Macrae-in-press.pdf</a> Why Self-Control Seems (but may not be) Limited</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw6/a_new_interpretation_of_the_marshmallow_test/#comments">Less Wrong discussion</a></p>

<p>A famous experiment showed that children who believe an adult&rsquo;s
promise to have two marshmallows if they&rsquo;ll wait a few minutes without
eating the marshmallow in front of them are more successful later in
life. Finally someone has raised what should
be an obvious objection: maybe the less successful adults were children
with bad parents and teachers, whose word couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. That
is, a possible common cause of adult failure and childhood
marshmallow-scarfing is distrust of authority.</p>

<p>They even performed an unsurprising experiment: the adults running it
lie to the kids a few times, and then try the
delayed-marshmallow-gratification promise. I&rsquo;m not sure what we&rsquo;re
supposed to learn from this as it&rsquo;s completely expected that people,
even kids, won&rsquo;t keep trusting in an environment where they&rsquo;re
repeatedly cheated. What&rsquo;s needed is to quantify separate influence
from &lsquo;trusting adult promises&rsquo; vs. &lsquo;having innate willpower&rsquo;, which
neither the original marshmallow setup nor this one can manage.</p>

<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://firewhenreadypottery.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/HUGE-marshmallow-768x1024.jpg">http://firewhenreadypottery.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/HUGE-marshmallow-768x1024.jpg</a>" width="768" height="1024" title="marshmallow" ></p>

<p>Study link: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712001849">Rational snacking</a></p>

<p>The problem is merely in the over-confident interpretations of very
coarse evidence. The VERY SMART SCIENTISTS write a nice hypothesis in
their paper and it gets bandied about in the press, but really they
need many more nuanced experiments (not just replication) before we
should really believe their explanation.</p>

<p>For example, it seems that people in a lab-experiment setting pretend
to be nicer than they really are (or have fellow-feeling for their
experiment-mates):</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>[As to how] how much Dictator Game giving is due to people knowing they’re in an experiment, the answer is, “all of it.”</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Robert Kurzban <a href="http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2013/05/are-all-dictator-game-results-artifacts/">http://www.epjournal.net/blog/2013/05/are-all-dictator-game-results-artifacts/</a> Are All Dictator Game Results Artifacts?</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>When given a chance to split a $20 gift of poker chips in Vegas with
the one person right next to them, if people are told they&rsquo;re (both)
in an experiment, 80% give at least $1 with the median being $5 (they
keep $15). Otherwise (out of 60 subjects), they never give
anything. (The use of chips is interesting &ndash; it adds to the
plausibility of the stealth-experiment case, but it&rsquo;s also pretty well
known that using things further from physical cash makes people less
loss-averse and perhaps more loose &ndash; see Club Med beads and carnival
tickets).</p>

<p>Anyway, as Kurzban points out, the Dictator Game was originally only
used as a control for the <em>effect</em> of being in an experiment, for the
more interesting Ultimatum game, where the person choosing the split
can have it vetoed by an offended recipient of a too-low offer (in
which case neither get anything). It&rsquo;s certainly a valid control &ndash;
this is just a reminder not to get too optimistic about how altruistic
people are to genuine strangers (rather than their fellow lab-rats).</p>

There's a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">NYTimes article</a> about his work, summarized and discussed on <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/75s/link_nytimes_essay_on_willpower_based_on_an/">LessWrong</a>.</p>


<p></p>


<p>  I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://graehl.org/tag/willpower">previously discussed</a> much of this. But some of it is new research.<p></p>  It&rsquo;s still possible that the only thing being depleted is glucose available to the brain (which is most readily available from stored liver glycogen, or food). But there may be other chemical resources involved. In any case, weighing and making choices taxes the brain; I&rsquo;m not sure how much more or less than e.g. solving puzzles or reading and thinking critically.<p></p>  Quoting from the LessWrong summary:<p></p></p>

<blockquote>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; font-size: small;">
</span><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">You spend the most willpower when you have to make AND implement your decisions:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">which phase of the decision-making process was most fatiguing? To find out, Kathleen Vohs, a former colleague of Baumeister’s now at the University of Minnesota, performed an experiment using the self-service Web site of Dell Computers. One group in the experiment carefully studied the advantages and disadvantages of various features available for a computer — the type of screen, the size of the hard drive, etc. — without actually making a final decision on which ones to choose. A second group was given a list of predetermined specifications and told to configure a computer by going through the laborious, step-by-step process of locating the specified features among the arrays of options and then clicking on the right ones. The purpose of this was to duplicate everything that happens in the postdecisional phase, when the choice is implemented.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The third group had to figure out for themselves which features they wanted on their computers and go through the process of choosing them; they didn’t simply ponder options (like the first group) or implement others’ choices (like the second group). They had to cast the die, and that turned out to be the most fatiguing task of all. When self-control was measured, they were the one who were most depleted, by far</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you reluctant to make trade-offs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Once you’re mentally depleted, you become reluctant to make trade-offs, which involve a particularly advanced and taxing form of decision making. In the rest of the animal kingdom, there aren’t a lot of protracted negotiations between predators and prey. To compromise is a complex human ability and therefore one of the first to decline when willpower is depleted. You become what researchers call a cognitive miser, hoarding your energy.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">If you’re shopping, you’re liable to look at only one dimension, like price: just give me the cheapest. Or you indulge yourself by looking at quality: I want the very best</em><span> </span>(an especially easy strategy if someone else is paying). Decision fatigue leaves you vulnerable to marketers who know how to time their sales, as Jonathan Levav, the Stanford professor, demonstrated in experiments involving tailored suits and new cars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Willpower depletion makes you more likely to take the path of least resistance:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">As they started picking features, customers would carefully weigh the choices, but<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">as decision fatigue set in, they would start settling for whatever the default option was. And the more tough choices they encountered early in the process — like going through those 56 colors to choose the precise shade of gray or brown — the quicker people became fatigued and settled for the path of least resistance by taking the default option.</em><span> </span>By manipulating the order of the car buyers’ choices, the researchers found that the customers would end up settling for different kinds of options, and the average difference totaled more than 1,500 euros per car (about $2,000 at the time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Testing willpower depletion in rural Indian villages:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Most of us in America won’t spend a lot of time agonizing over whether we can afford to buy soap, but it can be a depleting choice in rural India. Dean Spears, an economist at Princeton, offered people in 20 villages in Rajasthan in northwestern India the chance to buy a couple of bars of brand-name soap for the equivalent of less than 20 cents. It was a steep discount off the regular price, yet even that sum was a strain for the people in the 10 poorest villages. Whether or not they bought the soap, the act of making the decision left them with less willpower, as measured afterward in a test of how long they could squeeze a hand grip. In the slightly more affluent villages, people’s willpower wasn’t affected significantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Decision fatigue can be a factor in trapping people in poverty:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Spears and other researchers argue that this sort of decision fatigue is a major — and hitherto ignored — factor in trapping people in poverty. Because<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">their financial situation forces them to make so many trade-offs, they have less willpower to devote to school, work and other activities that might get them into the middle class</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Glucose restores willpower in humans and dogs:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">To establish cause and effect, researchers at Baumeister’s lab tried refueling the brain in a series of experiments involving lemonade mixed either with sugar or with a diet sweetener. The sugary lemonade provided a burst of glucose, the effects of which could be observed right away in the lab; the sugarless variety tasted quite similar without providing the same burst of glucose.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">Again and again, the sugar restored willpower, but the artificial sweetener had no effect.</em><span> </span>The glucose would at least mitigate the ego depletion and sometimes completely reverse it. The restored willpower improved people’s self-control as well as the quality of their decisions: they resisted irrational bias when making choices, and when asked to make financial decisions, they were more likely to choose the better long-term strategy instead of going for a quick payoff.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">The ego-depletion effect was even demonstrated with dogs in two studies by Holly Miller and Nathan DeWall at the University of Kentucky. After obeying sit and stay commands for 10 minutes, the dogs performed worse on self-control tests and were also more likely to make the dangerous decision to challenge another dog’s turf</em>. But a dose of glucose restored their willpower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #336699; padding-left: 4px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 15px;">
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">The results of the experiment were announced in January, during Heatherton’s speech accepting the leadership of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the world’s largest group of social psychologists. In his presidential address at the annual meeting in San Antonio, Heatherton reported that administering glucose completely reversed the brain changes wrought by depletion — a finding, he said, that thoroughly surprised him.<em style="font-style: italic;">Heatherton’s results did much more than provide additional confirmation that glucose is a vital part of willpower; they helped solve the puzzle over how glucose could work without global changes in the brain’s total energy use. Apparently ego depletion causes activity to rise in some parts of the brain and to decline in others. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. It responds more strongly to immediate rewards and pays less attention to long-term prospects</em>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Good decision makers structure their lives so as to conserve willpower:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Good decision making is not a trait of the person, in the sense that it’s always there,” Baumeister says. “It’s a state that fluctuates.” His studies show that people with the best self-control are the ones who structure their lives so as to conserve willpower.<span> </span><em style="font-style: italic;">They don’t schedule endless back-to-back meetings. They avoid temptations like all-you-can-eat buffets, and they establish habits that eliminate the mental effort of making choices. Instead of deciding every morning whether or not to force themselves to exercise, they set up regular appointments to work out with a friend</em>. Instead of counting on willpower to remain robust all day, they conserve it so that it’s available for emergencies and important decisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">“Even the wisest people won’t make good choices when they’re not rested and their glucose is low,” Baumeister points out.</p>

Some of the subjects were instructed to eat radishes and resist the sweets, and afterwards all were put to work on unsolvable geometric puzzles. Resisting the sweets, independent of mood, made participants give up more than twice as quickly on the geometric puzzles.

<p><br>Based on the reporter's description, I expected that the chocolate eaters merely tried harder because of the caffeine and sugar (both of which are known to help motivate or support mental labor).</p>


<p> </p>


<p>But the actual  study was careful of this (see <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/345/345%20Articles/Baumeister%20et%20al.%20%281998%29.pdf">pg 1254, Method</a>, and Table 1); a no-food no-temptation control group performed the same as the chocolate-indulging group. It was only the radish-eating chocolate-resisters (giving up 40% sooner due to the psychic pain of resisting a fresh-baked-chocolate-chip-cookie temptation).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>  (see previous &lt;a href=""&gt;discussion of ego-depletion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  It looks like people studying people's decline in vigilance-required tasks over time need to take care not to suggest to their subjects the idea that they will probably fatigue.  The theory is that tasks that specifically require "self control" can lead to specific fatigue in other "self control" tasks, as distinct from general mental fatigue, although it's been found that glucose availability to the brain explains most of this.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  A new &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/%7Egwalton/home/Publications_files/Job,%20Dweck,%20%26%20Walton,%202010.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which is much more careful than past ones, gives a pretty strong idea that people's expectations for how they'll perform while willpower-taxed are the determining factor (at least for artifical, low-motivation psych-study tasks), and further that when these expectations are manipulated (by push polling), that this obliterates the effects typically reported in the ego-depletion literature. Because of the push polling affecting performance, you can't just say that it's '&lt;span style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; font-size: small;"&gt;the person's idiosyncratic "availability of willpower" after a demanding task that shapes idiosyncratic beliefs about willpower'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  I reproduce here my comments from this &lt;a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2y2/willpower_not_a_limited_resource/"&gt;LessWrong discussion&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote type="cite"&gt;&lt;div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"&gt;

<div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; font-size: small;"> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">What's demonstrated: if you prime an excuse for doing poorly, you will do poorly. I think there's already some similar research (different types of excuses, though). They also show that self-reported exhaustion (not just "ego depleting" tasks) leads to a difference in performance that goes in exactly the direction that the subjects are primed to believe (either being reminded of an existing belief, or being tricked into holding it with biased questions).</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">It surprises me that, of the people who don't claim to expect to flag when fatigued, those who report being exhausted by the depletion task actually make less errors than those who don't. Unless this is just due to warming up their inhibition/vigilance (both the initial and final tests require it) while, it suggests that positive expectations can boost performance, not just that available excuses can harm it.</p> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">I like that they demonstrated that errors on IQ problems tracks errors on mundane rule-following, vigilance type tasks, but it's amusing to me that people who believe they'll do worse when fatigued, actually test as smarter (less IQ test errors) when fresh, whereas those primed to believe they won't effectively fatigue improve slightly, but are still worse than the "limited resource" believers initial performance. This effect is still there, but probably not significant, for the simple but tiresome "willpower" testing (Stroop) task. I assume the "limited"-believers are more engaged by an IQ-proving question, either for signaling or entertainment, compared to the boring Stroop task.

So it seems reasonable to assume that those who were push-polled into believing they will become either sloppier, or more accurate, with fatigue, would act consonantly.<div style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-size: medium;"><div style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify; font-size: small;"> <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;">But I don&rsquo;t think this objection is likely the whole story. The simplest explanation is that people&rsquo;s stated expectations of their performance do shape their performance &ndash; the power of positive thinking, and obviously, negative. (possibly unvoiced/persistent expectations as well as explicitly declared, although of course it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to measure such things surreptitiously).</p> </div></div>
